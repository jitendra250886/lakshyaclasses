# Here‚Äôs a complete and well-structured `blueprints/content.py` file 
# for your **LakshyaClasses** project. This blueprint handles 
# routing for class-wise and subject-wise content delivery, including 
# rendering Markdown notes, serving PDFs, and organizing educational material.

# Routes for the 'content' blueprint, registered via content_bp in __init__.py

from flask import render_template
from . import content_bp

@content_bp.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('content/index.html')  # Or any placeholder page

@content_bp.route('/materials')
def materials():
    return render_template('content/materials.html')  # Example route

@content_bp.route('/assignments')
def assignments():
    return render_template('content/assignments.html')  # Example route


"""
### üîç What this file handles:
- **Class page**: Lists subjects for a given class
- **Subject page**: Lists all files (notes, worksheets) under a subject
- **Markdown rendering**: Converts `.md` files to HTML using your `markdown_renderer.py`
- **PDF serving**: Sends `.pdf` files directly to the browser

---

### ‚úÖ Next Steps
You can now:
- Create `markdown_view.html`, `class_page.html`, and `subject_page.html` templates
- Add links to notes and worksheets from your dashboard or home page
- Extend this to allow quiz launching or worksheet submission

Want help building the templates or adding download buttons and preview links?

Notes:
You can expand this with routes for uploading PDFs, rendering Markdown, or serving course content.

Make sure your templates are placed under templates/content/ to match the render paths.

Register content_bp in your app factory:
from blueprints.content import content_bp
app.register_blueprint(content_bp)
