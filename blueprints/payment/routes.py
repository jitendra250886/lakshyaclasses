# Routes for the 'auth' blueprint, registered via auth_bp in __init__.py

# === This blueprint handles all payment-related routes for LakshyaClasses ===
# It includes initiating a course purchase, integrating with Razorpay,
# verifying payment success, and updating the database with purchase info.

"""
Python Comments Summary:
Every route and logic block is explained with inline comments
Explains how Razorpay integration works: order creation, verification, and database update
Uses student_id, class_name, and subject to track purchases
Redirects to course content after successful payment

Let me know if you want:
A sample razorpay_service.py implementation
To add support for free courses or coupons
To log failed payments or retry options
"""

"""
Notes:
Templates should live under templates/payment/.
You can later integrate Razorpay or Stripe SDKs into checkout and webhook.
Register payment_bp in your app factory:

python
from blueprints.payment import payment_bp
app.register_blueprint(payment_bp)

Let me know if you want me to scaffold the Razorpay integration next â€” I can 
wire up the client-side JS, server-side signature verification, and webhook flow.
