# === site.db ===
# This is your SQLite database file used by SQLAlchemy in development mode.
# It stores all persistent data for your LakshyaClasses project, including:
# - User accounts (from models/user.py)
# - Student profiles (from models/student.py)
# - Course purchases (from models/purchase.py)
# - Any future tables like submissions, quizzes, or progress tracking

# === How It's Created ===
# This file is auto-generated and managed by SQLAlchemy + Flask-Migrate.
# You should NOT manually edit or open this file directly.
# To initialize and manage the database schema, use:
#   flask db init
#   flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
#   flask db upgrade

# === Best Practices ===
# - Keep site.db inside the /instance folder (Flask convention)
# - Add site.db to .gitignore to avoid committing local data
# - Use flask shell or DB Browser for SQLite to inspect contents
# - For production, consider switching to PostgreSQL or MySQL

# === Migration & Inspection Support ===
# Let me know if you want help writing migration scripts,
# inspecting tables, or switching to a cloud database later.
