Generating NCERT Chapter Indexing in Markdown Format
"Create a Markdown file that lists all subjects and chapters for Class [X] based on the latest NCERT curriculum. Each subject should have its own section, and each chapter should be listed in the format CHAPTER-XX-TITLE-WITH-HYPHENS. Ensure the chapter titles are accurate and reflect the official NCERT textbook names. Repeat this structure for all subjects in the class."
