# Chapter 02 ‚Äì Exploring Substances: Acidic, Basic and Neutral

## üìñ Learning Objectives
- Define acids, bases and neutrals by their characteristic properties  
- Describe how indicators (like litmus, phenolphthalein, turmeric) reveal acidity or basicity  
- Understand the pH scale and its numerical range  
- Relate everyday substances to acidic, basic or neutral categories  

## üóùÔ∏è Key Terms
- Acid; Base; Neutral  
- Indicator; pH; Litmus; Phenolphthalein; Turmeric

## 1. Introduction
Substances around us‚Äîfoods, cleaners, medicines‚Äîshow different chemical behaviors. We classify them by how they react with indicators, taste, and pH.

---

## 2. Properties of Acids
- Sour taste (lemon juice, vinegar)  
- Turn blue litmus paper to red  
- Produce H‚Å∫ ions in water  
- pH less than 7  

### Common Acids
| Substance     | Source         | Approximate pH |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| Lemon juice   | Citrus fruits  | 2‚Äì3           |
| Vinegar       | Fermented juice| 2‚Äì3           |
| Dilute HCl    | Laboratory acid| ~1            |

## 3. Properties of Bases
- Bitter taste (soap, baking soda)  
- Turn red litmus paper to blue  
- Produce OH‚Åª ions in water  
- pH greater than 7  

### Common Bases
| Substance      | Use                   | Approximate pH |
|----------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| Soap solution  | Cleaning              | 9‚Äì10          |
| Baking soda    | Baking                | ~8            |
| Sodium hydroxide| Drain cleaner (conc.)| ~13           |

---

## 4. Neutral Substances
- Neither acidic nor basic  
- pH exactly 7  
- Pure water, salt solution  

---

## 5. Indicators
- **Litmus paper**: universal, red in acid, blue in base  
- **Phenolphthalein**: colourless in acid, pink in base  
- **Turmeric**: yellow in acid/neutral, red in strong base  

---

## 6. The pH Scale
- Numerical scale from 0 to 14  
  - 0‚Äì<7: Acidic  
  - 7: Neutral  
  - >7‚Äì14: Basic  
- Each unit change = tenfold [H‚Å∫] change  

---

## 7. Everyday Applications
- Soil pH for healthy plant growth  
- Stomach acid (pH ~2) for digestion  
- Antacids (pH ~8‚Äì9) to neutralize excess stomach acid  

---

## 8. Summary
- Acids give H‚Å∫ ions, bases give OH‚Åª  
- Indicators help classify substances quickly  
- pH tells us strength on a numeric scale
