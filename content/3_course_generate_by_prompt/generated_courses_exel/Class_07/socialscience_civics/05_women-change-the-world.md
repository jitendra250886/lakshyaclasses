# Women Change The World

## Introduction: Challenging Stereotypes

In our society, there are often fixed ideas and expectations about what women and men can or should do. These are known as **gender stereotypes**. For example, people might think that girls are best suited for jobs like teaching or nursing, while boys are better at being engineers or pilots. This chapter explores how women have challenged these stereotypes, fought for their rights, and changed the world through education and collective action.

Many roles and jobs are seen as more suitable for men than for women. This belief is a stereotype and does not reflect reality. Women are capable of performing any role, from being an army officer or a train driver to a scientist or a farmer.

## Fewer Opportunities and Rigid Expectations

Stereotypes create a world where girls and women are not given the same opportunities as boys and men.

*   **Limited Choices:** From a young age, girls are often encouraged to play with dolls while boys are given cars and building blocks. This subtly pushes them towards certain roles (homemaker, caregiver) and away from others (technical, scientific).
*   **Societal Pressure:** Society often puts pressure on women to get married and focus on family life, sometimes at the cost of their careers and personal ambitions.
*   **Breaking the Mould:** Many women have broken these stereotypes. For example, **Laxmi Lakra**, from a poor tribal family in Jharkhand, became the first woman engine driver for Northern Railways. She challenged the idea that technical jobs are only for men.

### Common Gender Stereotypes

| Stereotype for Men | Stereotype for Women |
| :--- | :--- |
| Strong and tough | Gentle and soft |
| Don't cry or show emotion | Emotional and sensitive |
| Good at maths and science | Good at arts and humanities |
| The primary breadwinner | The primary caregiver/homemaker |
| Suited for technical/physical jobs | Suited for caring/nurturing jobs |

## Learning for Change: The Power of Education

In the past, education was not accessible to most girls. It was believed that educating girls was unnecessary. However, many women struggled against this norm to gain knowledge, which became a powerful tool for their empowerment.

### Historical Examples

1.  **Rashsundari Devi (1800-1890):**
    *   Born in West Bengal, she was a housewife from a rich landlord's family.
    *   In those days, it was believed that if a woman learned to read and write, she would bring bad luck to her husband.
    *   Despite this, she secretly taught herself to read and write in the flickering light of a candle after everyone else was asleep.
    *   She wrote the first known autobiography by an Indian woman, titled **'Amar Jiban'** (My Life), in Bengali.

2.  **Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain (1880-1932):**
    *   She knew how to read and write Urdu but was forbidden from learning Bengali and English, which were seen as languages that would expose women to new ideas.
    *   With the support of her elder brother and husband, she learned both languages.
    *   She wrote a remarkable story called **'Sultanaâ€™s Dream'** in 1905, which imagined a world called 'Ladyland' where women ruled and lived freely.
    *   In 1910, she started a school for girls in Kolkata, which is still functioning today.

## Schooling and Education Today

Today, a large number of boys and girls attend school. However, significant differences still exist.

*   **Literacy Rates (Census 2011):**
    *   **All Persons:** 74%
    *   **Men:** 82%
    *   **Women:** 65%
    *   This shows a clear gap, meaning more men are literate than women.

*   **Reasons for School Dropouts:**
    While more girls are enrolling in schools, the dropout rate for girls, especially from Dalit, Adivasi, and Muslim communities, is high. The reasons include:
    *   **Poverty:** Many families cannot afford the cost of education for all their children.
    *   **Lack of Facilities:** Many rural schools lack proper buildings, teachers, and basic facilities like clean toilets, which particularly affects girls.
    *   **Preference for Boys' Education:** When resources are scarce, families may prefer to send their sons to school over their daughters.
    *   **Household Chores:** Girls are often expected to help with household work and care for younger siblings.
    *   **Discrimination:** Girls may face discrimination from teachers and classmates in school.

## The Women's Movement: Striving for Equality

The **Women's Movement** is a collective effort where women have struggled to bring about changes and fight for equality. People involved in this movement use different strategies to spread awareness, fight discrimination, and seek justice.

### Strategies of the Movement

1.  **Campaigning:** Campaigns have led to new laws and policies.
    *   **Anti-Dowry Laws:** In the 1980s, women's groups campaigned against dowry deaths, leading to stricter laws.
    *   **Sexual Harassment Guidelines:** Campaigns in the 1990s led to the Supreme Court laying down guidelines in 1997 to protect women from sexual harassment at the workplace.
    *   **Protection from Domestic Violence:** A law was passed in 2006 to give women facing domestic violence legal protection.

2.  **Raising Awareness:** Women's groups use street plays, songs, public meetings, and media to raise public awareness about women's rights and issues.

3.  **Protesting:** The movement uses public rallies and demonstrations to draw attention to injustices and demand action. When a law or policy acts against their interests, women's groups protest to make their voices heard.

4.  **Showing Solidarity:** The women's movement shows solidarity with other women and causes. For example, on March 8th, **International Women's Day**, women from all over the world come together to celebrate and renew their struggles.

## Summary

This chapter highlights the significant role women have played in changing the world by challenging deep-rooted gender stereotypes. Historically, women like Rashsundari Devi and Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain fought for their right to education, paving the way for future generations. While progress has been made in girls' education, gaps and challenges, especially for marginalised communities, still exist. The Women's Movement has been crucial in this struggle, using strategies like campaigning, protesting, and raising awareness to fight for legal rights, justice, and equality. The ongoing efforts of women continue to shape a more equal and just society for everyone.
