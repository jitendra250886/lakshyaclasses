# Chapter 9: A Shirt In The Market

## Introduction

This chapter tells the story of a simple shirt to help us understand the complex journey of a product before it reaches us. It follows the shirt from the cotton fields to the supermarket shelf. By doing so, it reveals the 'chain of markets' that connects different people like farmers, weavers, factory workers, and consumers. The chapter also highlights the inequalities present in this chain, questioning who truly benefits from these market transactions.

## The Journey of a Shirt: From Cotton to Consumer

The story of a shirt involves many different people and places, each forming a link in the chain of markets.

### 1. The Cotton Farmer in Kurnool

The journey begins with a small farmer, like Swapna from Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh, who grows cotton.

*   **High Investment:** Growing cotton is expensive. Farmers need to buy seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides.
*   **Dependence on Loans:** Small farmers often have to take loans from local traders to meet these expenses.
*   **Exploitative Conditions:** As a condition for the loan, the trader forces the farmer to sell the harvested cotton back to them at a price lower than the market rate.
*   **Low Earnings:** The farmer gets a very low price for their hard work and produce, barely enough to cover their costs and survive. They are caught in a cycle of debt.

### 2. The Cloth Market of Erode: The Putting-Out System

The cotton from the farmer is sold in markets. One such major cloth market is in Erode, Tamil Nadu. Here, the cotton goes through several stages before becoming cloth.

1.  **Ginning Mill:** The raw cotton is taken to a ginning mill, where the seeds are removed, and the cotton is pressed into bales.
2.  **Spinning Mill:** The bales are sold to spinning mills, where the cotton is spun into yarn (thread).
3.  **Weavers and the "Putting-Out" System:** The yarn is then sold to cloth merchants. These merchants use a system called the **"putting-out system"** to get the cloth woven.

#### What is the Putting-Out System?

This is a system where the merchant supplies the raw material (yarn) to the weavers at their homes and pays them for weaving it into cloth.

*   **Advantages for the Merchant:**
    *   They save money on buying and maintaining looms (weaving machines).
    *   They have complete control over the quality and quantity of cloth produced.
    *   They pay a very low price to the weavers for their work.
*   **Disadvantages for the Weaver:**
    *   They are completely dependent on the merchant for raw materials and work.
    *   They get a very low wage and have no way of knowing the actual market price of the cloth they produce.
    *   They have no bargaining power.

### 3. The Garment Exporting Factory near Delhi

The cloth made by the weavers in Erode is sold by the merchant to a garment exporting factory, often located near cities like Delhi.

*   **Making the Shirts:** The factory uses the cloth to stitch shirts according to the orders placed by foreign buyers (importers), usually from the USA or Europe.
*   **Pressure to Reduce Costs:** These foreign buyers are very powerful and demand the lowest prices from the exporter.
*   **Exploitation of Workers:** To maximize their own profit and meet the demands of the buyers, the garment factory owners cut costs by:
    *   Paying very low wages to their workers.
    *   Hiring workers on a temporary basis (casual workers), so they can be fired when there is no work.
    *   Making them work for long hours, especially when an order needs to be delivered quickly.

### 4. The Shirt in a US Supermarket

Finally, the finished shirts are exported and sold in foreign countries.

*   **The Importer's Role:** The foreign buyer (importer) who bought the shirts from the Indian exporter now sells them to large business chains and stores in their country.
*   **High Selling Price:** These stores sell the shirt to the final consumer at a very high price. For example, a shirt that the Indian exporter sold for ₹300 might be sold for $26 (around ₹1800) in the US.
*   **Profit Distribution:** The importer and the retail store make huge profits from advertising, branding, and storage, while the people who actually produced the shirt—the farmer and the worker—earn the least.

## Markets and Equality

The story of the shirt shows that while markets offer opportunities for people to work and sell what they produce, they are not always fair.

*   **The Chain of Markets:** A chain of markets connects the producer of cotton to the buyer of the shirt in the supermarket. Buying and selling takes place at every step in the chain.
*   **Inequality:** Not everyone benefits equally in this chain. The rich and powerful, like the large traders, exporters, and foreign business owners, make huge profits.
*   **Exploitation:** The small farmers, weavers, and factory workers have little power and are often exploited. They work very hard but earn very little.

## Who are the Gainers in the Market?

The following table gives a rough idea of who earns how much in this chain:

| Person in the Chain      | Role                                  | Profit/Earning |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Cotton Farmer**        | Grows the cotton                      | Very Low       |
| **Weaver**               | Weaves the cloth                      | Low            |
| **Factory Worker**       | Stitches the shirt                    | Low            |
| **Garment Exporter**     | Manages the factory and exports       | Moderate       |
| **Foreign Businessperson** | Imports and sells to retail stores    | High           |
| **Retail Store**         | Sells the shirt to the final consumer | Very High      |

Clearly, the people at the top of the chain (foreign businesses and retail stores) are the biggest gainers, while those at the bottom (farmers and workers) are the most disadvantaged.

## Summary

The chapter "A Shirt in the Market" traces the journey of a shirt from the cotton farm to the final consumer. This journey involves a **chain of markets** where buying and selling occur at each step. The story reveals significant **inequality**, where powerful players like exporters and foreign businesses make substantial profits. In contrast, small producers like farmers and weavers, along with factory workers, are often exploited, receiving very low returns for their hard work. The chapter concludes that while markets provide opportunities, they often fail to provide fair wages and equal benefits to everyone involved in the production process.
