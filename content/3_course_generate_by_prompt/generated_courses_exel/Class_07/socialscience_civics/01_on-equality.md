# Chapter 1: On Equality

## Introduction to Equality

Equality is a core principle of democracy. In a democratic country like India, all citizens are considered equal, regardless of their caste, religion, gender, economic status, or educational background. The Indian Constitution guarantees equality to all its citizens.

One of the most important aspects of this is the **Universal Adult Franchise**.

### Universal Adult Franchise

This principle is a cornerstone of all democracies and is based on the idea of equality.

-   **What it means:** It means that all adult citizens (18 years and above) have the right to vote, irrespective of their social or economic backgrounds.
-   **Why it's important:** It gives every adult citizen a direct role in electing their government. It reinforces the idea that every vote has equal value, whether the person is rich or poor, educated or uneducated.

> **Example: Kanta's Story**
> The chapter begins with Kanta, a domestic worker, standing in a line to vote. She is happy because in that line, her employer is standing with her, and everyone is equal. However, later in the day, she faces the harsh reality of inequality when she has to take her sick daughter to a government hospital and stand in a long queue, while her employer can afford private healthcare. This highlights the difference between political equality (equal voting rights) and the social and economic inequality that exists in our daily lives.

## Other Kinds of Inequality

While the right to vote provides political equality, it doesn't eliminate other forms of inequality that are deeply rooted in our society.

### 1. The Caste System

The caste system is one of the most common and rigid forms of social inequality in India. People are often discriminated against based on the caste they are born into. Dalits, a term used for the so-called 'lower castes', have faced centuries of discrimination.

> **Example: Omprakash Valmiki's Story**
> In his autobiography, *Joothan*, Omprakash Valmiki describes his painful experiences as a Dalit child. He was made to sit separately from other students in the classroom and was forced by the headmaster to sweep the entire school and playground. This treatment was unequal and violated his dignity.

### 2. Religious Discrimination

People are also discriminated against based on their religion. This can lead to them being denied housing, jobs, or other opportunities.

> **Example: The Ansaris' Story**
> Mr. and Mrs. Ansari, a Muslim couple, were looking to rent an apartment in a city. Despite having the money, they were rejected by several landlords as soon as they revealed their names. The property dealer suggested they change their names to 'Mr. and Mrs. Kumar', but the Ansaris refused to do so because it hurt their dignity.

## Recognising Dignity

**Dignity** refers to the self-respect of a person and the respect they deserve from others. When people are treated unequally, their dignity is violated.

-   Omprakash Valmiki's dignity was hurt when he was forced to sweep the school just because of his caste.
-   The Ansaris' dignity was hurt when people refused to rent them an apartment because of their religion.

The Indian Constitution recognises that every individual is equal and that their dignity must be respected.

## Equality in Indian Democracy

The Indian Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and it lays down provisions to ensure equality for all citizens.

### Key Constitutional Provisions for Equality

1.  **Equality before the law:** Every person, from the President of the country to a domestic worker like Kanta, has to obey the same laws.
2.  **Prohibition of discrimination (Article 15):** The state cannot discriminate against any citizen on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.
3.  **Equal access to public places:** Every person has access to all public places, including playgrounds, hotels, shops, and markets. All citizens can use public wells, roads, and bathing ghats.
4.  **Abolition of Untouchability (Article 17):** The practice of untouchability has been abolished, and its practice in any form is a punishable offense.

### How the Government Implements Equality

The government works to implement the equality guaranteed in the Constitution in two main ways:

1.  **Through Laws:** By creating and enforcing laws that protect every person's right to be treated equally.
2.  **Through Government Programmes/Schemes:** By launching schemes to help disadvantaged communities and improve their lives.

#### The Mid-Day Meal Scheme

This is one of the most important government schemes to promote equality.

-   **What it is:** A programme where all children in government elementary schools are provided with a cooked lunch.
-   **Origin:** Tamil Nadu was the first state in India to introduce this scheme. In 2001, the Supreme Court ordered all state governments to begin this programme in their schools within six months.
-   **Positive Effects:**
    -   **Increased Enrolment:** More poor children have started enrolling and regularly attending school.
    -   **Improved Nutrition:** It helps improve the nutritional status of students.
    -   **Reduced Caste Prejudice:** Children from all castes eat together, which helps break down caste barriers. In many places, Dalit women have been employed to cook the meals.

## Issues of Equality in Other Democracies

India is not the only democratic country where inequality exists. Many democracies around the world struggle with similar issues.

### The Civil Rights Movement in the USA

In the United States of America, African-Americans were historically treated very unequally.

-   **Segregation:** Before the 1960s, there was strict segregation. For example, on public buses, African-Americans had to give up their seats to a white person if asked.
-   **Rosa Parks (1955):** She was an African-American woman who refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man. Her act of defiance sparked the famous **Civil Rights Movement**.
-   **The Civil Rights Act of 1964:** This landmark law prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, religion, or national origin. It also stated that all schools would be open to African-American children.

## Summary

This chapter introduces the concept of equality as a key feature of Indian democracy. It explains that while the Constitution guarantees equality to all through provisions like the Universal Adult Franchise and Article 15, social and economic inequality still persist in society. The chapter uses stories of individuals like Kanta, Omprakash Valmiki, and the Ansaris to illustrate different forms of discrimination based on class, caste, and religion. It highlights how discrimination violates a person's dignity. The government tries to enforce equality through laws and schemes like the Mid-Day Meal programme. Finally, the chapter shows that the struggle for equality is not unique to India but is a global challenge, as seen in the Civil Rights Movement in the USA.
