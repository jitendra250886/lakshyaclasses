# Role Of The Government In Health

## What is Health?

In simple terms, health means our ability to remain free of illness and injuries. However, health isn't only about disease. It also includes having access to clean drinking water, a pollution-free environment, nutritious food, and living without mental stress. All these aspects are crucial for a healthy life.

In a democracy, it is the expectation of the people that the government works for their welfare. This includes providing healthcare, education, employment, and other essential services. This chapter focuses on the role of the government in providing healthcare to its citizens.

## Healthcare in India: A Mixed Picture

India presents a picture of contrasts when it comes to healthcare. We have both significant strengths and persistent challenges.

| Positives (India's Strengths)                                  | Negatives (India's Challenges)                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| India has the largest number of medical colleges in the world. | Most doctors settle in urban areas, leaving rural areas underserved. |
| We are among the largest producers of doctors.                 | About 5 lakh people die from tuberculosis every year.              |
| Healthcare facilities have grown substantially over the years. | Almost two million cases of malaria are reported annually.         |
| India gets a large number of medical tourists from many countries. | We are not able to provide clean drinking water to all.            |
| India is the third-largest producer of medicines in the world. | Half of all children in India do not get adequate food and are undernourished. |

To prevent and treat illnesses, we need appropriate healthcare facilities such as health centres, hospitals, laboratories for testing, ambulance services, blood banks, etc. The government is responsible for developing these facilities.

## Public and Private Healthcare Services

Healthcare facilities in India can be broadly divided into two categories:

1.  **Public Services**
2.  **Private Services**

### 1. Public Healthcare Services

This is a system of hospitals and health centres run by the government. They are designed to provide quality healthcare either for free or at a very low cost, so that even the poorest can seek treatment.

*   **Structure:** They are linked together to cover both rural and urban areas.
    *   **Village Level:** Health centres with a nurse and a trained village health worker. They deal with common illnesses.
    *   **Block Level:** Primary Health Centre (PHC) which supervises the village centres.
    *   **District Level:** District Hospital that supervises all the health centres in the district. Large cities have many government hospitals.
*   **Funding:** The resources to run these services come from the taxes that we, the public, pay to the government.
*   **Key Functions:**
    *   Treating a wide range of illnesses, from common colds to serious diseases.
    *   Taking action to prevent the spread of diseases like tuberculosis (TB), malaria, jaundice, polio, etc. This is often done through public awareness campaigns.

According to our Constitution, it is the **primary duty of the government** to ensure the welfare of the people and provide healthcare facilities for all. The government must safeguard the **Right to Life** of every person.

### 2. Private Health Facilities

These are clinics and hospitals that are not owned or controlled by the government.

*   **Presence:** A wide range of private health facilities exist in our country. A large number of doctors run their own private clinics, especially in urban areas.
*   **Types:** There are hospitals, nursing homes, laboratories, and specialised facilities (X-ray, ultrasound, etc.) that are privately owned.
*   **Cost:** Patients have to pay a lot of money for every service that they use in private facilities. These are run for profit.
*   **Regulation:** While they are not government-owned, the government does have a role in regulating them to ensure they meet certain standards.

## Healthcare and Equality: Is Adequate Healthcare Available to All?

In India, we see that private healthcare services are increasing, but public services are not. This creates a significant problem of inequality.

*   **Cost Barrier:** Private services are concentrated in urban areas and are very expensive. Many people cannot afford them or have to borrow money to pay for treatment. This can lead to immense hardship and debt.
*   **Unethical Practices:** To earn more money, some private practitioners are known to prescribe unnecessary medicines, injections, or tests.
*   **Affordability:** Studies show that only about 20% of the population can afford all the medicines that they require during an illness. For those who are poor, every illness in the family is a cause of great anxiety and distress.

## What Can Be Done? The Government's Responsibility

There is little doubt that the health situation of most people in our country is not good. It is the government's responsibility to provide quality healthcare services to all its citizens, especially the poor and the disadvantaged.

The solution lies in strengthening the public healthcare system and ensuring it is accessible and affordable for everyone, particularly in rural areas.

## Learning from Examples

Some states and countries have shown how healthcare for all can be achieved.

### 1. The Kerala Experience

In 1996, the Kerala government made a major change. It gave **40 percent of the entire state budget to the panchayats**. This allowed villages to plan and provide for their own requirements.
*   **Impact:** This led to proper planning for water, food, women's development, and education.
*   **Health Improvements:** Water supply schemes were checked, the working of schools and anganwadis was ensured, and specific problems of the village were taken up. This helped improve the overall health situation significantly.

### 2. The Costa Rican Approach

Costa Rica, a country in Central America, is considered one of the healthiest in the region.
*   **Key Decision:** Many years ago, Costa Rica took an important decision and decided **not to have an army**.
*   **Redirecting Funds:** This allowed the government to spend the money that would have been used for the army on health, education, and other basic needs of the people.
*   **Government's Role:** The Costa Rican government provides all basic services and amenities to its citizens, such as safe drinking water, sanitation, nutrition, and housing. Health education is also considered very important.

## Summary

*   **Health** is a broad concept that includes physical, mental, and social well-being, not just the absence of disease.
*   The government has a primary responsibility to provide **healthcare for all**, as it is part of the fundamental "Right to Life".
*   India has a two-tiered healthcare system: **public** (government-run, low-cost) and **private** (profit-oriented, expensive).
*   A major challenge is **inequality**, as expensive private care is often out of reach for the poor, while public services need improvement.
*   Examples from **Kerala** (decentralised planning) and **Costa Rica** (prioritising health over military spending) show that positive change is possible with the right government policies.
