# Chapter 4: Growing Up As Boys And Girls

## Introduction
From a very young age, society teaches us how to behave, what is acceptable for us to do, and what we can become based on whether we are a boy or a girl. This chapter explores how these gender roles are created and how they lead to inequality. We will look at examples from different parts of the world and different time periods to understand that these roles are not natural but are created by society.

## Growing Up in Samoa in the 1920s
To understand how different societies shape gender roles, let's look at the experience of children in the Samoan islands in the Pacific during the 1920s.

*   **No Schooling:** Children did not go to school. They learned important life skills from older children and adults.
*   **Learning from Others:** Toddlers were looked after by their older siblings. This responsibility was taken on by children as young as five years old.
*   **Different Roles for Teenagers:**
    *   **Boys:** Around the age of nine, boys joined the older boys to learn outdoor jobs like fishing and planting coconuts.
    *   **Girls:** Girls continued to look after small children or do errands for adults until they were teenagers.
*   **Teenage Freedom:** Once girls became teenagers (around 14), they had more freedom. They went on fishing trips, worked in plantations, and learned to weave baskets.

This example shows that the experience of growing up is not the same everywhere. The roles we associate with boys and girls today were very different in Samoan society.

## Growing Up Male in Madhya Pradesh in the 1960s
This case study from our own country shows how differently boys and girls were treated, even in the design of their schools and their use of public spaces.

| Aspect | Girls' Experience | Boys' Experience |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **School Design** | The school had a central courtyard where girls played in total seclusion and safety. | The school had no such courtyard. Their playground was a big open space attached to the school. |
| **After School** | Girls walked home in groups, often feeling scared or purposeful to avoid being stared at or teased. The street was just a way to get home. | Boys used the streets as a place to stand around idly, to play, and to try out tricks with their bicycles. The street was a place for fun. |

These two examples show that society creates clear distinctions between boys and girls. They are given different toys, taught different manners, and the spaces they use are often defined differently. This teaches them that their roles in society as men and women are separate and distinct.

## Valuing Housework
A significant part of growing up is learning the roles we are expected to play. For girls, this often includes learning housework.

*   **The Invisible Work:** The main responsibility for housework (like cooking, cleaning, washing) and care-giving (looking after children, the elderly, or sick family members) lies with women.
*   **Not Recognised as 'Work':** This work is often not considered "real work" because it is not paid. It is assumed to be something that women are naturally good at or are supposed to do.
*   **Devaluation:** Because it is unpaid, this essential work is often devalued by society.
*   **Physically Demanding and Time-Consuming:** Housework is not easy. It involves heavy physical labour and long hours. In rural areas, women and girls often spend hours fetching water and firewood.

### The "Double Burden"
When women work outside the home, they often still have to do all the housework and caregiving. This is known as the **double burden**.

## Lives of Domestic Workers
Many families, especially in towns and cities, hire domestic workers to help with housework.

*   **Who are they?** Most domestic workers are women, and sometimes young girls.
*   **What do they do?** Their work includes sweeping, cleaning, washing clothes, cooking, and looking after children.
*   **Challenges Faced:**
    *   **Low Wages:** Domestic work is not valued highly, so their wages are often very low.
    *   **Long Hours:** A typical day can start as early as 5 in the morning and end late at night.
    *   **Lack of Respect:** Despite the hard work they put in, they are often not treated with respect by their employers.

## Women's Work and Equality
The principle of equality is a cornerstone of our Constitution. It states that being male or female should not be a reason for discrimination. However, in reality, inequality between the sexes exists.

The government has taken several steps to address this inequality and recognise the burden of caregiving and housework on women:

1.  **Anganwadis:** The government has set up *anganwadis* or child-care centres in several villages. This helps children get care and nutrition, and allows mothers to work.
2.  **Crèche Facilities:** The government has passed a law making it mandatory for organisations with more than 30 women employees to provide crèche (childcare) facilities.
3.  **Support for Girls' Education:** Providing crèches makes it easier for women to work outside the home and also makes it possible for more girls to attend school, as they are no longer required to stay home to care for younger siblings.

## Summary
This chapter highlights that the roles assigned to boys and girls are not universal or natural but are created by society. These roles often lead to the devaluation of work done by women, particularly housework and caregiving, which is often unpaid and invisible. While our Constitution guarantees equality, significant inequalities still exist. The government is taking steps, such as setting up childcare centres and mandating crèches, to support women, recognise the value of their work, and move towards a more equal society.
