# Chapter 11: Perimeter and Area

## Introduction

In this chapter, we will learn about two important measurements related to plane figures: perimeter and area. These concepts are widely used in our daily lives, from fencing a garden to painting a wall.

### What is Perimeter?

The **perimeter** is the total distance around a closed figure. It is the length of the boundary of a shape. Imagine walking along the edges of a park; the total distance you walk is its perimeter.

*   **Unit:** The unit of perimeter is the same as the unit of length (e.g., cm, m, km).

### What is Area?

The **area** is the measure of the surface or region enclosed by a closed figure. It tells us how much space the figure occupies. For example, the amount of carpet needed to cover a room is determined by its area.

*   **Unit:** The unit of area is a square unit (e.g., cm², m², km²).

## Squares and Rectangles

Let's revisit the formulas for the perimeter and area of squares and rectangles.

### Square

A square is a four-sided figure with all sides of equal length and all angles equal to 90°.

*   **Perimeter of a Square** = 4 × side
*   **Area of a Square** = side × side = (side)²

**Example:** Find the perimeter and area of a square park whose side is 20 m.
*   Perimeter = 4 × 20 m = 80 m
*   Area = 20 m × 20 m = 400 m²

### Rectangle

A rectangle is a four-sided figure with opposite sides of equal length and all angles equal to 90°.

*   **Perimeter of a Rectangle** = 2 × (length + breadth)
*   **Area of a Rectangle** = length × breadth

**Example:** A rectangular sheet of paper is 15 cm long and 10 cm wide. Find its area and perimeter.
*   Perimeter = 2 × (15 cm + 10 cm) = 2 × 25 cm = 50 cm
*   Area = 15 cm × 10 cm = 150 cm²

## Area of a Parallelogram

A parallelogram is a four-sided figure with two pairs of parallel sides. The area of a parallelogram is found by multiplying its base by its corresponding height.

*   **Base (b):** Any side of the parallelogram can be chosen as the base.
*   **Height (h):** The height is the perpendicular distance from the chosen base to the opposite side.

**Formula:**
**Area of a Parallelogram = base × height**



**Example:** Find the area of a parallelogram with a base of 8 cm and a corresponding height of 5 cm.
*   Area = base × height = 8 cm × 5 cm = 40 cm²

## Area of a Triangle

A triangle is a three-sided closed figure. The area of a triangle is half the product of its base and its corresponding height (altitude).

*   **Base (b):** Any side of the triangle can be its base.
*   **Height (h):** The height is the length of the perpendicular from the opposite vertex to the base.

**Formula:**
**Area of a Triangle = ½ × base × height**



**Example:** Find the area of a triangle whose base is 10 cm and height is 6 cm.
*   Area = ½ × 10 cm × 6 cm = 30 cm²

## Circles

A circle is a round, two-dimensional shape. All points on its boundary are equidistant from a central point.

*   **Radius (r):** The distance from the center to any point on the circle.
*   **Diameter (d):** The distance across the circle passing through the center. **d = 2r**.
*   **Circumference (C):** The perimeter or distance around the circle.

### Circumference of a Circle

The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is a constant value called **Pi (π)**.
The approximate value of π is **22/7** or **3.14**.

**Formula:**
*   **Circumference (C) = 2πr** (using radius)
*   **Circumference (C) = πd** (using diameter)

**Example:** Find the circumference of a circle with a radius of 7 cm. (Use π = 22/7)
*   C = 2 × (22/7) × 7 cm = 44 cm

### Area of a Circle

The area of a circle is calculated using its radius and the value of π.

**Formula:**
**Area (A) = πr²**

**Example:** Find the area of a circle with a radius of 14 m. (Use π = 22/7)
*   Area = (22/7) × (14 m)² = (22/7) × 196 m² = 22 × 28 m² = 616 m²

## Applications and Unit Conversions

### Area of Paths

We often need to calculate the area of paths or borders built around or inside a shape. To do this, we find the area of the larger shape and subtract the area of the smaller shape.

**Example:** A rectangular park is 50 m long and 30 m wide. A 2 m wide path is built outside the park. Find the area of the path.
1.  **Area of the park (inner rectangle):**
    *   Area = 50 m × 30 m = 1500 m²
2.  **Dimensions of the park including the path (outer rectangle):**
    *   New Length = 50 m + 2 m + 2 m = 54 m
    *   New Breadth = 30 m + 2 m + 2 m = 34 m
3.  **Area of the outer rectangle:**
    *   Area = 54 m × 34 m = 1836 m²
4.  **Area of the path:**
    *   Area of path = Area of outer rectangle - Area of inner rectangle
    *   Area of path = 1836 m² - 1500 m² = 336 m²

### Unit Conversions

It is important to know how to convert between different units of area.

| Length Conversion | Area Conversion |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 cm = 10 mm | 1 cm² = 100 mm² |
| 1 m = 100 cm | 1 m² = 10,000 cm² |
| 1 km = 1000 m | 1 km² = 1,000,000 m² |

Another common unit for large areas is the **hectare**.
*   **1 hectare = 10,000 m²**

## Summary

This chapter covers the fundamental concepts of perimeter (the distance around a shape) and area (the space a shape covers).

| Shape | Perimeter/Circumference | Area |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Square** | 4 × side | (side)² |
| **Rectangle** | 2 × (length + breadth) | length × breadth |
| **Parallelogram** | 2 × (sum of adjacent sides) | base × height |
| **Triangle** | Sum of three sides | ½ × base × height |
| **Circle** | 2πr or πd | πr² |
