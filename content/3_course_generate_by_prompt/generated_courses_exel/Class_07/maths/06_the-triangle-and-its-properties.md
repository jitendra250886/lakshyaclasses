# Chapter 6: The Triangle And Its Properties

## 1. Introduction to Triangles

A **triangle** is a simple closed curve made of three line segments. It is a three-sided polygon.

A triangle has three main elements:
*   **Vertices:** The points where the sides meet. In ΔABC, the vertices are A, B, and C.
*   **Sides:** The line segments that form the triangle. In ΔABC, the sides are AB, BC, and CA.
*   **Angles:** The angles formed at each vertex. In ΔABC, the angles are ∠BAC, ∠ABC, and ∠BCA (or simply ∠A, ∠B, and ∠C).



## 2. Classification of Triangles

Triangles can be classified in two ways: based on the length of their sides and based on the measure of their angles.

### Based on Sides
| Type | Property | Diagram |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scalene Triangle** | All three sides have different lengths. |  |
| **Isosceles Triangle** | Any two sides have the same length. |  |
| **Equilateral Triangle** | All three sides are equal in length. |  |

### Based on Angles
| Type | Property | Diagram |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Acute-angled Triangle** | All three angles are acute (less than 90°). |  |
| **Right-angled Triangle** | One angle is a right angle (exactly 90°). |  |
| **Obtuse-angled Triangle** | One angle is an obtuse angle (greater than 90°). |  |

## 3. Medians of a Triangle

A **median** of a triangle is a line segment that connects a vertex to the **mid-point** of the opposite side.

*   In ΔABC, if D is the mid-point of BC, then AD is the median from vertex A.
*   A triangle has **three** medians.
*   The point where all three medians intersect is called the **centroid**.



## 4. Altitudes of a Triangle

An **altitude** of a triangle is the perpendicular line segment from a vertex to its opposite side. It represents the 'height' of the triangle.

*   In ΔPQR, PS is the altitude from vertex P to the side QR (PS ⊥ QR).
*   A triangle has **three** altitudes.
*   The position of the altitude can change depending on the type of triangle:
    *   **Acute Triangle:** Inside the triangle.
    *   **Right Triangle:** Two altitudes are the legs (sides) of the triangle.
    *   **Obtuse Triangle:** The altitude from the obtuse angle is inside, while the other two are outside the triangle.



## 5. Exterior Angle Property

An **exterior angle** of a triangle is formed when one side of the triangle is extended. The exterior angle is equal to the sum of the two **interior opposite angles**.

*   In the figure, ∠ACD is the exterior angle.
*   The interior opposite angles are ∠A and ∠B.
*   **Property:** `Exterior Angle = Sum of Interior Opposite Angles`
*   `∠ACD = ∠A + ∠B`



## 6. Angle Sum Property of a Triangle

This is one of the most important properties of a triangle.

*   **Property:** The sum of the measures of the three interior angles of a triangle is always **180°**.
*   For any ΔABC: `∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°`

**Example:** If in a triangle, ∠A = 50° and ∠B = 70°, find ∠C.
*   We know ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°
*   50° + 70° + ∠C = 180°
*   120° + ∠C = 180°
*   ∠C = 180° - 120° = 60°

## 7. Properties of Special Triangles

### Isosceles Triangle
*   **Property 1:** The angles opposite to the equal sides are equal.
    *   If AB = AC, then ∠C = ∠B.
*   **Property 2 (Converse):** The sides opposite to the equal angles are equal.
    *   If ∠C = ∠B, then AB = AC.

### Equilateral Triangle
*   All sides are equal in length.
*   All interior angles are equal.
*   Since the total sum is 180°, each angle measures `180° / 3 = 60°`.

## 8. Triangle Inequality Property

This property determines if a triangle can be formed with given side lengths.

*   **Property:** The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is always **greater than** the length of the third side.
*   For a triangle with sides a, b, and c:
    *   `a + b > c`
    *   `b + c > a`
    *   `a + c > b`

**Example:** Can a triangle have sides 3 cm, 4 cm, and 8 cm?
*   Check the conditions:
    *   3 + 4 > 8  (7 > 8, which is **False**)
*   Since one condition fails, a triangle cannot be formed with these side lengths.

## 9. Right-Angled Triangles and the Pythagoras Property

This property applies **only** to right-angled triangles.

*   **Hypotenuse:** The side opposite the right angle. It is the longest side.
*   **Legs:** The other two sides that form the right angle.

### Pythagoras Theorem
In a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (legs).

*   **Formula:** `(Leg1)² + (Leg2)² = (Hypotenuse)²`
*   If a and b are the legs and c is the hypotenuse, then: `a² + b² = c²`



**Example:** In a right-angled triangle, the legs are 6 cm and 8 cm. Find the hypotenuse.
*   Let a = 6 cm, b = 8 cm. We need to find c.
*   a² + b² = c²
*   6² + 8² = c²
*   36 + 64 = c²
*   100 = c²
*   c = √100 = 10 cm.
*   The hypotenuse is 10 cm.

## Summary

*   A **triangle** is a 3-sided polygon with 3 vertices, 3 sides, and 3 angles.
*   Triangles are classified by **sides** (Scalene, Isosceles, Equilateral) and by **angles** (Acute, Right, Obtuse).
*   A **median** connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.
*   An **altitude** is the perpendicular height from a vertex to the opposite side.
*   **Exterior Angle Property:** The exterior angle equals the sum of the two interior opposite angles.
*   **Angle Sum Property:** The sum of all three interior angles of a triangle is always 180°.
*   **Triangle Inequality Property:** The sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.
*   **Pythagoras Property:** In a right-angled triangle, `(Leg1)² + (Leg2)² = (Hypotenuse)²`.
