# Chapter 7: Congruence of Triangles

## Introduction to Congruence

The word **"congruent"** means equal in all respects. Two figures are congruent if they have the same shape and the same size. You can think of them as exact copies or clones of each other. If you place one congruent figure on top of the other, it will cover it completely.

*   **Real-life Examples:** Two biscuits from the same packet, two 10-rupee coins, two ATM cards from the same bank.
*   **Symbol:** The symbol for congruence is **≅**. So, if figure A is congruent to figure B, we write it as A ≅ B.

### Congruence among Plane Figures

*   **Congruence of Line Segments:** Two line segments are congruent if they have the same length. If AB = 5 cm and PQ = 5 cm, then line segment AB ≅ line segment PQ.
*   **Congruence of Angles:** Two angles are congruent if they have the same measure. If ∠ABC = 50° and ∠XYZ = 50°, then ∠ABC ≅ ∠XYZ.

## Congruence of Triangles

Two triangles are congruent if their corresponding sides and corresponding angles are equal. This means that if you could "cut out" one triangle, it would fit perfectly over the other one.

When we say that **ΔABC ≅ ΔPQR**, it means that the correspondence between the vertices is:
A ↔ P, B ↔ Q, C ↔ R

This correspondence implies that the corresponding parts are equal:

| Corresponding Vertices | Corresponding Sides | Corresponding Angles |
| :-------------------- | :----------------- | :------------------ |
| A ↔ P                 | AB = PQ            | ∠A = ∠P             |
| B ↔ Q                 | BC = QR            | ∠B = ∠Q             |
| C ↔ R                 | AC = PR            | ∠C = ∠R             |

**Important Note:** The order of the letters in the congruence notation is very important as it indicates the correspondence between the vertices.

### CPCTC

This is a very important acronym that stands for:
**C**orresponding **P**arts of **C**ongruent **T**riangles are **C**ongruent.

Once we have proved that two triangles are congruent using one of the criteria below, we can state that their remaining corresponding parts are also equal by using CPCTC.

## Criteria for Congruence of Triangles

We don't need to check all six corresponding parts (3 sides and 3 angles) to prove that two triangles are congruent. We can use any one of the following four criteria.

### 1. SSS (Side-Side-Side) Congruence Criterion

If the three sides of one triangle are equal to the three corresponding sides of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.

**Explanation:**
Consider ΔABC and ΔPQR.
*   If AB = PQ
*   If BC = QR
*   If AC = PR
Then, **ΔABC ≅ ΔPQR** (by SSS criterion).



### 2. SAS (Side-Angle-Side) Congruence Criterion

If two sides and the *included angle* of one triangle are equal to the two corresponding sides and the *included angle* of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.

**What is an "included angle"?**
The included angle is the angle formed *between* the two sides being considered. In ΔABC, ∠B is the included angle between sides AB and BC.

**Explanation:**
Consider ΔLMN and ΔXYZ.
*   If LM = XY (Side)
*   If ∠M = ∠Y (Included Angle)
*   If MN = YZ (Side)
Then, **ΔLMN ≅ ΔXYZ** (by SAS criterion).



### 3. ASA (Angle-Side-Angle) Congruence Criterion

If two angles and the *included side* of one triangle are equal to the two corresponding angles and the *included side* of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.

**What is an "included side"?**
The included side is the side *between* the two angles being considered. In ΔABC, side BC is the included side between ∠B and ∠C.

**Explanation:**
Consider ΔABC and ΔDEF.
*   If ∠B = ∠E (Angle)
*   If BC = EF (Included Side)
*   If ∠C = ∠F (Angle)
Then, **ΔABC ≅ ΔDEF** (by ASA criterion).



> **Note on AAS Congruence:** If two angles and a non-included side of a triangle are equal to the corresponding parts of another triangle, the triangles are still congruent. This is called the **AAS criterion**. It works because if two angles are equal, the third angle must also be equal (by the angle sum property of a triangle), which then makes it an ASA case.

### 4. RHS (Right angle-Hypotenuse-Side) Congruence Criterion

If in two **right-angled triangles**, the hypotenuse and one side of one triangle are equal to the hypotenuse and one corresponding side of the other triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.

**Conditions for RHS:**
1.  Both triangles must be right-angled (one angle is 90°).
2.  The hypotenuses of both triangles must be equal. (The hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle).
3.  One pair of corresponding sides must be equal.

**Explanation:**
Consider two right-angled triangles ΔPQR and ΔXYZ, where ∠Q = ∠Y = 90°.
*   If ∠Q = ∠Y = 90° (Right angle)
*   If PR = XZ (Hypotenuse)
*   If PQ = XY (Side)
Then, **ΔPQR ≅ ΔXYZ** (by RHS criterion).



## Summary

*   **Congruent Figures:** Figures that have the same shape and size. The symbol is **≅**.
*   **Congruent Triangles:** Two triangles are congruent if their corresponding sides and angles are equal. The order of vertices matters when writing the congruence relation.
*   **CPCTC:** Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles are Congruent.
*   **Criteria for Congruence:** We can prove triangles are congruent using any of these four rules:
    1.  **SSS:** All three corresponding sides are equal.
    2.  **SAS:** Two corresponding sides and the angle between them are equal.
    3.  **ASA:** Two corresponding angles and the side between them are equal.
    4.  **RHS:** In right-angled triangles, the hypotenuse and one corresponding side are equal.
