# Class 7 Maths - Chapter 1: Integers

## Introduction to Integers

In earlier classes, we learned about natural numbers (1, 2, 3, ...) and whole numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, ...). However, these numbers are not enough to represent situations like temperatures below 0°C, depths below sea level, or financial losses. For this, we need negative numbers.

**Integers** are a larger collection of numbers that include all whole numbers and their negative counterparts.

-   **Positive Integers:** 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
-   **Negative Integers:** -1, -2, -3, -4, ...
-   **Zero:** 0 (which is neither positive nor negative)

The complete set of integers can be represented as: `..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...`

### Representing Integers on a Number Line

A number line is a visual way to represent integers.
-   Zero is the center.
-   Positive integers are on the right of zero.
-   Negative integers are on the left of zero.



-   As we move to the right on the number line, the value of the integer increases. For example, `5 > 2` and `-1 > -4`.
-   As we move to the left, the value of the integer decreases. For example, `-5 < -2` and `1 < 4`.

## Properties of Addition and Subtraction of Integers

Integers follow certain properties or rules for addition and subtraction.

| Property | Addition | Subtraction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Closure** | Integers are closed under addition. If `a` and `b` are integers, `a + b` is also an integer. <br> *Example:* `5 + (-3) = 2` (an integer) | Integers are closed under subtraction. If `a` and `b` are integers, `a - b` is also an integer. <br> *Example:* `7 - 10 = -3` (an integer) |
| **Commutative** | Addition is commutative for integers. `a + b = b + a` <br> *Example:* `(-8) + (-9) = -17` and `(-9) + (-8) = -17` | Subtraction is **not** commutative for integers. `a - b ≠ b - a` <br> *Example:* `5 - 3 = 2` but `3 - 5 = -2` |
| **Associative** | Addition is associative for integers. `(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)` <br> *Example:* `(-5 + -3) + -2 = -8 + -2 = -10` and `-5 + (-3 + -2) = -5 + -5 = -10` | Subtraction is **not** associative for integers. `(a - b) - c ≠ a - (b - c)` <br> *Example:* `(5 - 3) - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0` but `5 - (3 - 2) = 5 - 1 = 4` |
| **Additive Identity** | Zero (0) is the additive identity for integers. `a + 0 = 0 + a = a` <br> *Example:* `(-6) + 0 = -6` | Not applicable. |

## Multiplication of Integers

Multiplying integers involves two parts: multiplying the numbers and determining the sign of the result.

### Rules for Signs in Multiplication

1.  **Positive × Positive = Positive**
    -   `(+) × (+) = +`
    -   *Example:* `5 × 3 = 15`
2.  **Positive × Negative = Negative**
    -   `(+) × (-) = -`
    -   *Example:* `4 × (-6) = -24`
3.  **Negative × Positive = Negative**
    -   `(-) × (+) = -`
    -   *Example:* `(-7) × 2 = -14`
4.  **Negative × Negative = Positive**
    -   `(-) × (-) = +`
    -   *Example:* `(-5) × (-8) = 40`

**Quick Tip:** If you multiply an **odd** number of negative integers, the result is negative. If you multiply an **even** number of negative integers, the result is positive.
-   `(-2) × (-3) × (-4) = -24` (3 negative integers - odd)
-   `(-2) × (-3) × (-4) × (-1) = 24` (4 negative integers - even)

### Properties of Multiplication

| Property | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Closure** | The product of two integers is always an integer. `a × b` is an integer. | `(-20) × (-5) = 100` (an integer) |
| **Commutative** | The order of multiplication does not change the result. `a × b = b × a` | `3 × (-4) = -12` and `(-4) × 3 = -12` |
| **Associative** | The grouping of integers does not change the result. `(a × b) × c = a × (b × c)` | `(7 × -2) × 5 = -14 × 5 = -70` and `7 × (-2 × 5) = 7 × -10 = -70` |
| **Multiplicative Identity** | One (1) is the multiplicative identity. `a × 1 = 1 × a = a` | `(-9) × 1 = -9` |
| **Multiplication by Zero** | Any integer multiplied by zero is zero. `a × 0 = 0 × a = 0` | `(-15) × 0 = 0` |
| **Distributive** | Multiplication distributes over addition. `a × (b + c) = (a × b) + (a × c)` | `(-4) × (2 + 3) = (-4) × 5 = -20` <br> `((-4) × 2) + ((-4) × 3) = -8 + (-12) = -20` |

## Division of Integers

Division is the inverse operation of multiplication. The rules for signs are similar to multiplication.

### Rules for Signs in Division

1.  `(+) ÷ (+) = +` (e.g., `10 ÷ 2 = 5`)
2.  `(+) ÷ (-) = -` (e.g., `12 ÷ (-3) = -4`)
3.  `(-) ÷ (+) = -` (e.g., `(-15) ÷ 5 = -3`)
4.  `(-) ÷ (-) = +` (e.g., `(-20) ÷ (-4) = 5`)

### Properties of Division

Division of integers is much more restrictive than multiplication.

1.  **Closure:** Division is **not** closed for integers.
    -   *Example:* `(-9) ÷ 2 = -4.5`, which is not an integer.
2.  **Commutative:** Division is **not** commutative.
    -   *Example:* `(-8) ÷ 4 = -2`, but `4 ÷ (-8) = -0.5`.
3.  **Division by Zero:** Division by 0 is **undefined**.
    -   `a ÷ 0` is not defined for any integer `a`.
4.  **Division by 1:** Any integer divided by 1 is the integer itself.
    -   `a ÷ 1 = a`
    -   *Example:* `(-7) ÷ 1 = -7`

## Summary

-   **Integers** are the set of whole numbers and their negative counterparts (`..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...`).
-   **Addition and Subtraction:** Integers are closed, commutative (addition only), and associative (addition only). The additive identity is 0.
-   **Multiplication:** Integers are closed, commutative, and associative. The multiplicative identity is 1. The distributive property `a × (b + c) = ab + ac` is very useful.
-   **Sign Rules for Multiplication/Division:**
    -   Same signs (`+` and `+`, or `-` and `-`) give a **positive** result.
    -   Different signs (`+` and `-`) give a **negative** result.
-   **Division:** Division is not closed or commutative for integers. Division by 0 is undefined.
