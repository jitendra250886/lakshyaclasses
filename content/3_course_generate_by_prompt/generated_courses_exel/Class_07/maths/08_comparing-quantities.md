# Chapter 8: Comparing Quantities

## Introduction

In our daily lives, we often need to compare two or more quantities. For example, we might compare the heights of two people, the marks obtained by different students, or the prices of two different items. This chapter will teach you the mathematical tools used for such comparisons, primarily focusing on **Ratios**, **Percentages**, **Profit & Loss**, and **Simple Interest**.

## Ratios

A ratio is a way to compare two quantities of the same kind by division. The quantities must have the **same units**. The symbol for ratio is **:** (colon).

For two quantities 'a' and 'b', the ratio is written as `a : b`, which is read as "a is to b". This can also be written as the fraction `a/b`.

**Example:** Find the ratio of 3 km to 300 m.
1.  **Convert to the same unit:** We know that 1 km = 1000 m. So, 3 km = 3 × 1000 m = 3000 m.
2.  **Find the ratio:** Now, we compare 3000 m to 300 m.
    Ratio = 3000 / 300 = 10 / 1
3.  **Write in ratio form:** The ratio is `10 : 1`.

### Equivalent Ratios

Equivalent ratios are ratios that have the same value, even though the numbers might be different. We can get an equivalent ratio by multiplying or dividing both terms of the ratio by the same non-zero number.

**Example:** Is the ratio `2 : 3` equivalent to `4 : 6`?
*   The first ratio is `2/3`.
*   The second ratio is `4/6`. If we simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2, we get `(4 ÷ 2) / (6 ÷ 2) = 2/3`.
*   Since both ratios simplify to the same fraction, they are equivalent. `2 : 3 = 4 : 6`.

## Percentage - Another Way of Comparing

A percentage is a special type of ratio where the second term (or denominator) is always 100. The word "per cent" means "per hundred" or "out of 100". The symbol for percentage is **%**.

For example, 25% means 25 out of 100, or `25/100`.

### Converting to and from Percentages

| Conversion Type | Method | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fraction to Percentage** | Multiply the fraction by 100 and add the % symbol. | `3/4` → `(3/4) × 100 % = 75%` |
| **Decimal to Percentage** | Multiply the decimal by 100 (or shift the decimal point two places to the right) and add the % symbol. | `0.65` → `0.65 × 100 % = 65%` |
| **Percentage to Fraction** | Remove the % symbol and divide by 100. Simplify the fraction. | `40%` → `40/100 = 2/5` |
| **Percentage to Decimal** | Remove the % symbol and divide by 100 (or shift the decimal point two places to the left). | `88%` → `88/100 = 0.88` |

### Using Percentages

1.  **Finding Percentage of a Quantity:**
    To find a percentage of a given number, convert the percentage to a fraction or decimal and then multiply.

    **Example:** Find 20% of 150.
    `20% of 150 = (20/100) × 150 = (1/5) × 150 = 30`

2.  **Expressing one quantity as a percentage of another:**
    To express quantity 'A' as a percentage of quantity 'B', use the formula: `(A / B) × 100 %`

    **Example:** What percentage is 15 of 60?
    `Percentage = (15 / 60) × 100 % = (1/4) × 100 % = 25%`

### Increase or Decrease as Percent

This is used to measure the change in a quantity over time.

*   **Percent Increase** = `(Amount of Increase / Original Amount) × 100 %`
*   **Percent Decrease** = `(Amount of Decrease / Original Amount) × 100 %`

**Example:** The price of a shirt decreased from ₹80 to ₹60. Find the percentage decrease.
1.  **Amount of Decrease** = Original Price - New Price = ₹80 - ₹60 = ₹20.
2.  **Original Amount** = ₹80.
3.  **Percent Decrease** = `(20 / 80) × 100 % = (1/4) × 100 % = 25%`.

## Profit and Loss

When we buy and sell things, we either make a profit or a loss.

*   **Cost Price (CP):** The price at which an item is purchased.
*   **Selling Price (SP):** The price at which an item is sold.

1.  **Profit:** If `SP > CP`, there is a profit.
    `Profit = SP - CP`

2.  **Loss:** If `CP > SP`, there is a loss.
    `Loss = CP - SP`

### Profit and Loss Percentage

We always calculate profit or loss percentage on the **Cost Price (CP)**.

*   **Profit %** = `(Profit / CP) × 100 %`
*   **Loss %** = `(Loss / CP) × 100 %`

**Example:** A shopkeeper bought a chair for ₹375 and sold it for ₹400. Find the gain (profit) percentage.
1.  **CP** = ₹375
2.  **SP** = ₹400
3.  Since SP > CP, there is a profit.
4.  **Profit** = SP - CP = 400 - 375 = ₹25.
5.  **Profit %** = `(Profit / CP) × 100 % = (25 / 375) × 100 = 6.67%`.

## Simple Interest

When you borrow money from a bank, you have to pay an extra amount for using their money. This extra amount is called **Interest**.

*   **Principal (P):** The original sum of money borrowed or lent.
*   **Rate of Interest (R):** The interest paid on ₹100 for one year. It is always expressed as a percentage per year (p.a.).
*   **Time (T):** The duration for which the money is borrowed. It must be in years.
*   **Simple Interest (SI):** The interest calculated only on the original principal amount.

The formula to calculate Simple Interest is:
`SI = (P × R × T) / 100`

*   **Amount (A):** The total money paid back at the end of the time period.
    `Amount = Principal + Simple Interest`
    `A = P + SI`

**Example:** Anita takes a loan of ₹5,000 at 15% per year as the rate of interest. Find the interest she has to pay at the end of one year.
1.  **P** = ₹5,000
2.  **R** = 15% per year
3.  **T** = 1 year
4.  **SI** = `(P × R × T) / 100 = (5000 × 15 × 1) / 100 = 50 × 15 = ₹750`.
5.  The total **Amount** to be paid back is A = P + SI = 5000 + 750 = ₹5,750.

## Summary

*   **Ratios** are used to compare two quantities with the same units.
*   **Percentages** are ratios where the denominator is 100. They are a universal tool for comparison.
*   We can convert fractions and decimals into percentages and vice versa.
*   **Profit** occurs when Selling Price (SP) is greater than Cost Price (CP). **Loss** occurs when CP is greater than SP.
*   Profit % and Loss % are always calculated on the CP.
*   **Simple Interest (SI)** is the extra money paid for borrowing a sum (Principal).
*   The formula for Simple Interest is `SI = (P × R × T) / 100`.
*   The total **Amount** to be repaid is Principal + Simple Interest.
