# Chapter 14: Symmetry

## Introduction to Symmetry

Symmetry is a fundamental concept in geometry and is seen all around us in nature, art, and architecture. An object is said to be **symmetrical** if it has a balanced and proportionate similarity in its two halves. It means that one half is the mirror image of the other half. The imaginary line or axis along which you can fold a figure to obtain the symmetrical halves is called the **line of symmetry**.

**Examples:**
*   A butterfly's wings are symmetrical.
*   The Taj Mahal is a perfect example of architectural symmetry.
*   Many letters in the English alphabet, like A, H, and M, are symmetrical.

## Lines of Symmetry

A line of symmetry divides a figure into two identical parts. Each part is a mirror image of the other. A shape can have:
*   No line of symmetry
*   One line of symmetry
*   Two lines of symmetry
*   Multiple lines of symmetry

### Lines of Symmetry for Regular Polygons

A **regular polygon** is a polygon that has all sides of equal length and all interior angles of equal measure. A key property of regular polygons is that the number of lines of symmetry is equal to the number of its sides.

| Shape | Number of Sides | Number of Lines of Symmetry | Diagram Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Equilateral Triangle** | 3 | 3 | The lines of symmetry connect each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. |
| **Square** | 4 | 4 | Two lines connect the midpoints of opposite sides, and two lines are the diagonals. |
| **Regular Pentagon** | 5 | 5 | Each line of symmetry connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. |
| **Regular Hexagon** | 6 | 6 | Three lines connect opposite vertices, and three lines connect the midpoints of opposite sides. |
| **Circle** | Infinite | Infinite | Any line passing through the centre of the circle is a line of symmetry. |

## Rotational Symmetry

When an object is rotated around a fixed point (the **centre of rotation**) and it looks exactly the same at certain angles, it is said to have **rotational symmetry**.

### Key Terms

*   **Centre of Rotation:** The fixed point about which the rotation occurs.
*   **Angle of Rotation:** The minimum angle by which the figure must be rotated to look the same as its original position.
*   **Order of Rotational Symmetry:** The number of times a figure fits onto itself in one complete rotation (360°).

The order of rotational symmetry can be calculated as:
**Order = 360° / (Angle of Rotation)**

### Examples of Rotational Symmetry

| Shape | Centre of Rotation | Angle of Rotation | Order of Rotational Symmetry |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Square** | Intersection of diagonals | 90° | 4 |
| **Rectangle** | Intersection of diagonals | 180° | 2 |
| **Equilateral Triangle** | Centroid | 120° | 3 |
| **Parallelogram** | Intersection of diagonals | 180° | 2 |
| **Circle** | Centre | Any angle | Infinite |
| **Letter 'S'** | Midpoint | 180° | 2 |


*A square has a rotational symmetry of order 4. It looks the same after rotations of 90°, 180°, and 270°.*

## Line Symmetry and Rotational Symmetry

Many shapes have both line symmetry and rotational symmetry, while some have only one or neither.

*   **Square:** Has 4 lines of symmetry and rotational symmetry of order 4.
*   **Rectangle:** Has 2 lines of symmetry and rotational symmetry of order 2.
*   **Isosceles Triangle:** Has 1 line of symmetry but no rotational symmetry (order 1 is considered no symmetry).
*   **Parallelogram:** Has no lines of symmetry but has rotational symmetry of order 2.
*   **Scalene Triangle:** Has no line of symmetry and no rotational symmetry.
*   **Letter 'H':** Has 2 lines of symmetry (horizontal and vertical) and rotational symmetry of order 2.
*   **Letter 'N':** Has no line of symmetry but has rotational symmetry of order 2.

## Summary

Symmetry is a concept of balance and harmony in shapes.
*   **Line Symmetry (or Reflectional Symmetry):** A shape has line symmetry if it can be divided by a line into two identical, mirror-image halves. This line is called the line of symmetry.
*   **Regular Polygons:** The number of lines of symmetry in a regular polygon is equal to its number of sides.
*   **Rotational Symmetry:** A shape has rotational symmetry if it looks the same after being rotated by an angle less than 360° around a central point.
*   **Order of Rotation:** This is the number of times a shape fits into its original outline during a full 360° turn.
*   Some figures can have both line and rotational symmetry, only one type, or neither.
