# Chapter 13: Exponents And Powers

## Introduction to Exponents

Sometimes we have to work with very large numbers, like the mass of the Earth or the distance between the Sun and the Earth. Writing these numbers repeatedly can be difficult. To make it easier, we use exponents.

An exponent is a way of expressing large numbers in a short form.

For example, the number 10,000 can be written as:
`10,000 = 10 × 10 × 10 × 10`

In a shorter form, we write this as **10⁴**.

Here:
*   **10** is called the **base**.
*   **4** is called the **exponent** or **power**.

We read **10⁴** as "10 raised to the power of 4" or "the fourth power of 10".

The expression **10⁴** is the **exponential form** of 10,000.

**Example:**
*   `81 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 3⁴` (Here, the base is 3 and the exponent is 4).
*   `64 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 2⁶` (Here, the base is 2 and the exponent is 6).

### Powers with Negative Integers as Base

We can also have negative integers as the base.

**Example 1:** `(-2)³`
`(-2)³ = (-2) × (-2) × (-2) = 4 × (-2) = -8`

**Example 2:** `(-2)⁴`
`(-2)⁴ = (-2) × (-2) × (-2) × (-2) = 4 × 4 = 16`

From these examples, we can see a pattern:
*   If a negative number is raised to an **odd** power, the result is **negative**.
*   If a negative number is raised to an **even** power, the result is **positive**.

> **Important Note:** Be careful with the placement of the negative sign.
> `(-3)² = (-3) × (-3) = 9`
> `-3² = -(3 × 3) = -9`
> In `(-3)²`, the base is -3. In `-3²`, the base is 3.

## Laws of Exponents

To make calculations involving exponents easier, we use certain rules called the **Laws of Exponents**. Let 'a' and 'b' be any non-zero integers and 'm' and 'n' be whole numbers.

### 1. Multiplying Powers with the Same Base

When multiplying powers with the same base, we keep the base and add the exponents.

*   **Rule:** `aᵐ × aⁿ = aᵐ⁺ⁿ`
*   **Example:** `5³ × 5⁴ = 5³⁺⁴ = 5⁷`

### 2. Dividing Powers with the Same Base

When dividing powers with the same base, we keep the base and subtract the exponents.

*   **Rule:** `aᵐ ÷ aⁿ = aᵐ⁻ⁿ` (where m > n)
*   **Example:** `7⁶ ÷ 7² = 7⁶⁻² = 7⁴`

### 3. Taking Power of a Power

When raising a power to another power, we keep the base and multiply the exponents.

*   **Rule:** `(aᵐ)ⁿ = aᵐⁿ`
*   **Example:** `(3²)⁴ = 3²ˣ⁴ = 3⁸`

### 4. Multiplying Powers with the Same Exponent

When multiplying powers with different bases but the same exponent, we multiply the bases and keep the exponent.

*   **Rule:** `aᵐ × bᵐ = (ab)ᵐ`
*   **Example:** `2⁵ × 3⁵ = (2 × 3)⁵ = 6⁵`

### 5. Dividing Powers with the Same Exponent

When dividing powers with different bases but the same exponent, we divide the bases and keep the exponent.

*   **Rule:** `aᵐ ÷ bᵐ = (a/b)ᵐ`
*   **Example:** `8³ ÷ 4³ = (8/4)³ = 2³`

### 6. Numbers with Exponent Zero

Any non-zero number raised to the power of zero is 1.

*   **Rule:** `a⁰ = 1` (where a ≠ 0)
*   **Example:** `9⁰ = 1`
*   **Explanation:** `5³ ÷ 5³ = 1`. Using the division rule, `5³ ÷ 5³ = 5³⁻³ = 5⁰`. Therefore, `5⁰ = 1`.

### Laws of Exponents at a Glance

| Law | Rule | Example |
| :-- | :--- | :------ |
| Multiplication (Same Base) | `aᵐ × aⁿ = aᵐ⁺ⁿ` | `2³ × 2² = 2⁵` |
| Division (Same Base) | `aᵐ ÷ aⁿ = aᵐ⁻ⁿ` | `3⁵ ÷ 3² = 3³` |
| Power of a Power | `(aᵐ)ⁿ = aᵐⁿ` | `(5²)³ = 5⁶` |
| Multiplication (Same Exponent) | `aᵐ × bᵐ = (ab)ᵐ` | `4² × 2² = (8)²` |
| Division (Same Exponent) | `aᵐ ÷ bᵐ = (a/b)ᵐ` | `6³ ÷ 2³ = (3)³` |
| Zero Exponent | `a⁰ = 1` | `7⁰ = 1` |

## Expressing Large Numbers in Standard Form

We often encounter very large numbers in science and real life. To make them easy to read, write, and compare, we use the **standard form** (also known as **scientific notation**).

A number is said to be in standard form if it is expressed as:
`k × 10ⁿ`
where `1 ≤ k < 10` (k is a decimal number between 1 and 10) and `n` is a whole number.

### How to Convert a Number to Standard Form

1.  Move the decimal point to the left until there is only one non-zero digit to its left. This gives you the value of `k`.
2.  Count the number of places you moved the decimal point. This number will be your exponent, `n`.
3.  Write the number in the form `k × 10ⁿ`.

**Example 1: Write 343,000 in standard form.**
1.  The number is `343000`. We place the decimal after the first digit, 3. The new number is `3.43`.
2.  To get from `343000` to `3.43`, we moved the decimal point **5** places to the left.
3.  So, the standard form is `3.43 × 10⁵`.

**Example 2: The distance of the Sun from the center of our galaxy is estimated to be 300,000,000,000,000,000,000 m.**
1.  Move the decimal point so it is between the first two digits: `3.0`.
2.  We moved the decimal point **20** places to the left.
3.  So, the standard form is `3.0 × 10²⁰ m`.

## Summary

*   **Exponents** are used to write very large numbers in a compact form. In `aⁿ`, 'a' is the base and 'n' is the exponent.
*   The value of `aⁿ` is `a` multiplied by itself `n` times.
*   The **Laws of Exponents** are rules that simplify calculations involving powers. Key laws include rules for multiplication, division, power of a power, and the zero exponent.
*   **Standard Form** (or scientific notation) is a convenient way to write very large numbers. It is expressed as `k × 10ⁿ`, where `1 ≤ k < 10`.
