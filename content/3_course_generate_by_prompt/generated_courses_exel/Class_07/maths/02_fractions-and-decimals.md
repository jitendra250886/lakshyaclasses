# Chapter 2: Fractions And Decimals

## Introduction to Fractions

### What is a Fraction?
A fraction represents a part of a whole. When a whole object or a collection of objects is divided into equal parts, each part is a fraction of the whole.

A fraction is written as `Numerator / Denominator`.
*   **Numerator:** The top number, which tells us how many equal parts are being considered.
*   **Denominator:** The bottom number, which tells us the total number of equal parts the whole is divided into.

**Example:** In the fraction `3/4`, the whole is divided into 4 equal parts, and we are considering 3 of those parts.

### Types of Fractions

1.  **Proper Fractions:** The numerator is smaller than the denominator. These fractions represent a value less than 1.
    *   **Examples:** `1/2`, `3/5`, `7/10`

2.  **Improper Fractions:** The numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator. These fractions represent a value equal to or greater than 1.
    *   **Examples:** `5/3`, `7/4`, `8/8`

3.  **Mixed Fractions:** A combination of a whole number and a proper fraction.
    *   **Examples:** `1 1/2`, `2 3/4`

#### Converting Between Mixed and Improper Fractions

*   **Mixed to Improper:** `(Whole Number × Denominator) + Numerator / Denominator`
    *   **Example:** `2 3/4 = (2 × 4) + 3 / 4 = 8 + 3 / 4 = 11/4`

*   **Improper to Mixed:** Divide the numerator by the denominator. The quotient is the whole number, the remainder is the new numerator, and the denominator stays the same.
    *   **Example:** `11/4` -> 11 ÷ 4 = 2 with a remainder of 3. So, `11/4 = 2 3/4`

## Operations on Fractions

### Multiplication of Fractions

#### 1. Multiplication of a Fraction by a Whole Number
Multiply the whole number with the numerator of the fraction, keeping the denominator the same.

*   **Formula:** `Whole Number × (Numerator / Denominator) = (Whole Number × Numerator) / Denominator`
*   **Example:** `3 × (2/5) = (3 × 2) / 5 = 6/5`

#### 2. Multiplication of a Fraction by a Fraction
Multiply the numerators together and the denominators together. The word 'of' in problems often means multiplication.

*   **Formula:** `(a/b) × (c/d) = (a × c) / (b × d)`
*   **Example:** `(1/2) × (3/4) = (1 × 3) / (2 × 4) = 3/8`
*   **Example with 'of':** Find `1/2` of 10. This means `(1/2) × 10 = 10/2 = 5`.

### Division of Fractions

To divide fractions, we use the concept of a **reciprocal**.

#### Reciprocal of a Fraction
The reciprocal of a fraction is found by inverting it (swapping the numerator and the denominator). The product of a fraction and its reciprocal is always 1.

*   The reciprocal of `a/b` is `b/a`.
*   **Example:** The reciprocal of `2/3` is `3/2`.

#### Division Rule
To divide a fraction by another fraction, multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction.

*   **Formula:** `(a/b) ÷ (c/d) = (a/b) × (d/c)`

**Types of Division:**

1.  **Division of a Whole Number by a Fraction:**
    *   **Example:** `5 ÷ (2/3) = 5 × (3/2) = 15/2`

2.  **Division of a Fraction by a Whole Number:**
    *   **Example:** `(2/3) ÷ 5 = (2/3) ÷ (5/1) = (2/3) × (1/5) = 2/15`

3.  **Division of a Fraction by Another Fraction:**
    *   **Example:** `(2/5) ÷ (3/4) = (2/5) × (4/3) = (2 × 4) / (5 × 3) = 8/15`

## Introduction to Decimals

Decimals are a way of writing numbers that are not whole numbers. They are fractions where the denominator is a power of 10 (like 10, 100, 1000, etc.).

**Example:** `0.7` is the same as `7/10`. `1.25` is the same as `125/100`.

### Place Value and Comparison of Decimals

The place value chart helps in understanding and comparing decimals.

| Place Value | Hundreds (100) | Tens (10) | Ones (1) | . | Tenths (1/10) | Hundredths (1/100) | Thousandths (1/1000) |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|----------|---|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Example: 24.53** |                | 2         | 4        | . | 5             | 3                 |                      |

To compare decimals, start from the leftmost digit and compare them. If they are equal, move to the next digit to the right until you find a difference.

**Example:** Compare 32.55 and 32.50.
1.  The tens digit (3) is the same.
2.  The ones digit (2) is the same.
3.  The tenths digit (5) is the same.
4.  The hundredths digit (5 > 0).
Therefore, `32.55 > 32.50`.

## Operations on Decimals

### Multiplication of Decimal Numbers

1.  **Multiplication by 10, 100, 1000:**
    When multiplying a decimal by 10, 100, or 1000, the decimal point shifts to the right by as many places as there are zeros in the multiplier.
    *   `1.76 × 10 = 17.6` (1 zero, shift 1 place)
    *   `1.76 × 100 = 176` (2 zeros, shift 2 places)
    *   `1.76 × 1000 = 1760` (3 zeros, shift 3 places)

2.  **Multiplication of a Decimal by a Decimal:**
    *   **Step 1:** Multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers (ignore the decimal points).
    *   **Step 2:** Count the total number of decimal places in both numbers being multiplied.
    *   **Step 3:** Place the decimal point in the product so that it has the same number of decimal places as the total counted in Step 2.
    *   **Example:** `2.5 × 0.3`
        *   Step 1: `25 × 3 = 75`
        *   Step 2: `2.5` has 1 decimal place, `0.3` has 1 decimal place. Total = 2 decimal places.
        *   Step 3: Place the decimal point 2 places from the right in 75. So, the answer is `0.75`.

### Division of Decimal Numbers

1.  **Division by 10, 100, 1000:**
    When dividing a decimal by 10, 100, or 1000, the decimal point shifts to the left by as many places as there are zeros in the divisor.
    *   `43.5 ÷ 10 = 4.35` (1 zero, shift 1 place)
    *   `43.5 ÷ 100 = 0.435` (2 zeros, shift 2 places)
    *   `43.5 ÷ 1000 = 0.0435` (3 zeros, shift 3 places)

2.  **Division of a Decimal by a Whole Number:**
    Divide as you would with whole numbers, but place the decimal point in the quotient directly above the decimal point in the dividend.
    *   **Example:** `7.5 ÷ 3` -> `75 ÷ 3 = 25`. Since 7.5 has one decimal place, the answer is `2.5`.

3.  **Division of a Decimal by a Decimal:**
    *   **Step 1:** Make the divisor a whole number by shifting its decimal point to the right.
    *   **Step 2:** Shift the decimal point in the dividend to the right by the same number of places.
    *   **Step 3:** Divide the new dividend by the new (whole number) divisor.
    *   **Example:** `7.75 ÷ 0.25`
        *   Step 1: To make `0.25` a whole number, shift the decimal 2 places right to get `25`.
        *   Step 2: Shift the decimal in `7.75` two places right to get `775`.
        *   Step 3: Now divide `775` by `25`. `775 ÷ 25 = 31`.

## Summary
This chapter covers the fundamental concepts and operations related to fractions and decimals. We learned about different types of fractions (proper, improper, mixed) and how to multiply and divide them using the concept of reciprocals. We also explored decimals, their place value, and how to perform multiplication and division with them. A key takeaway for decimal operations is the rule of shifting the decimal point based on the operation (multiplication/division) and the numbers involved (powers of 10 or other decimals).
