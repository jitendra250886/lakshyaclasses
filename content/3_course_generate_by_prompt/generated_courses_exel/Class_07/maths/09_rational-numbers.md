# Chapter 9: Rational Numbers

## Introduction

So far, we have learned about different types of numbers:
*   **Natural Numbers:** The counting numbers (1, 2, 3, ...).
*   **Whole Numbers:** Natural numbers including zero (0, 1, 2, 3, ...).
*   **Integers:** Whole numbers and their negative counterparts (..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...).
*   **Fractions:** Numbers that represent a part of a whole, like 1/2, 3/4, etc.

Now, we need a broader category of numbers that includes both integers and fractions. For example, what do we call a number like -3/4? This is where **Rational Numbers** come in.

## What are Rational Numbers?

A **rational number** is defined as any number that can be expressed in the form **p/q**, where:
*   `p` and `q` are integers.
*   `q` is not equal to zero (q ≠ 0).

Here, `p` is called the **numerator** and `q` is called the **denominator**.

**Examples:**
*   **1/2** (Here, p=1, q=2)
*   **-5/7** (Here, p=-5, q=7)
*   **4** (This is a rational number because it can be written as 4/1)
*   **-3** (This is a rational number because it can be written as -3/1)
*   **0** (This is a rational number because it can be written as 0/1, 0/5, etc.)

> **Why can't q be zero?**
> Division by zero is undefined in mathematics. Therefore, the denominator of a rational number can never be zero.

### Equivalent Rational Numbers

Equivalent rational numbers are numbers that have the same value but are represented differently. We can get an equivalent rational number by multiplying or dividing both the numerator and the denominator of a given rational number by the same non-zero integer.

**Example:**
Find equivalent rational numbers for **2/3**.
*   Multiply by 2: (2 × 2) / (3 × 2) = **4/6**
*   Multiply by 5: (2 × 5) / (3 × 5) = **10/15**
*   Multiply by -4: (2 × -4) / (3 × -4) = **-8/-12**

So, 2/3, 4/6, 10/15, and -8/-12 are all equivalent rational numbers.

## Positive and Negative Rational Numbers

1.  **Positive Rational Numbers:** A rational number is positive if both its numerator and denominator have the same sign (either both are positive or both are negative).
    *   Examples: 5/7, 2/3, -3/-8, -11/-5

2.  **Negative Rational Numbers:** A rational number is negative if its numerator and denominator have opposite signs (one is positive and the other is negative).
    *   Examples: -2/9, 5/-12, -1/3

> **Note:** The number 0 is neither a positive nor a negative rational number.

## Rational Numbers on a Number Line

We can represent rational numbers on a number line just like we represent integers.
*   Positive rational numbers are on the right side of 0.
*   Negative rational numbers are on the left side of 0.

**Steps to represent a rational number p/q:**
1.  Draw a number line.
2.  Look at the denominator `q`. Divide the length between each pair of consecutive integers (like 0 and 1, or -1 and -2) into `q` equal parts.
3.  Look at the numerator `p`. Starting from 0, move `p` steps. Move to the right for a positive numerator and to the left for a negative numerator.

**Example: Represent 3/4 on the number line.**
1.  The number is between 0 and 1.
2.  The denominator is 4, so we divide the space between 0 and 1 into 4 equal parts.
3.  The numerator is 3, so we move 3 parts to the right of 0.



**Example: Represent -5/3 on the number line.**
1.  First, convert it to a mixed fraction: -5/3 = -1 ⅔. This means the number lies between -1 and -2.
2.  The denominator is 3, so we divide the space between -1 and -2 into 3 equal parts.
3.  We need to mark the second part from -1 (moving towards -2).



## Standard Form of a Rational Number

A rational number is said to be in its **standard form** (or simplest form) if:
1.  Its denominator is a positive integer.
2.  The numerator and denominator have no common factor other than 1 (they are co-prime).

**Example: Reduce 36/-24 to its standard form.**
1.  **Make the denominator positive:** The denominator is -24. Multiply both numerator and denominator by -1.
    (36 × -1) / (-24 × -1) = -36/24
2.  **Find the HCF:** Find the Highest Common Factor (HCF) of 36 and 24. The HCF is 12.
3.  **Divide by HCF:** Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 12.
    (-36 ÷ 12) / (24 ÷ 12) = -3/2

So, the standard form of 36/-24 is **-3/2**.

## Comparison of Rational Numbers

To compare two rational numbers, follow these steps:
1.  Make sure the denominators of both numbers are positive.
2.  Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the denominators.
3.  Convert both rational numbers into their equivalent forms with the LCM as the new denominator.
4.  Compare their numerators. The rational number with the larger numerator is the greater one.

**Example: Compare -4/5 and -5/7.**
1.  Denominators (5 and 7) are already positive.
2.  LCM of 5 and 7 is 35.
3.  Convert the numbers:
    *   -4/5 = (-4 × 7) / (5 × 7) = -28/35
    *   -5/7 = (-5 × 5) / (7 × 5) = -25/35
4.  Compare the numerators: -28 and -25.
    Since -25 is greater than -28,
    -25/35 > -28/35
    Therefore, **-5/7 > -4/5**.

## Operations on Rational Numbers

### 1. Addition
*   **With Same Denominator:** Add the numerators and keep the common denominator.
    *   Example: 5/4 + (-11/4) = (5 + (-11))/4 = -6/4 = -3/2
*   **With Different Denominators:** Find the LCM of the denominators, create equivalent rational numbers, and then add.
    *   Example: -3/7 + 2/3
        *   LCM of 7 and 3 is 21.
        *   (-3/7) = (-9/21) and (2/3) = (14/21)
        *   (-9/21) + (14/21) = (-9 + 14)/21 = **5/21**

### 2. Subtraction
To subtract a rational number, we add its **additive inverse**. The additive inverse of `p/q` is `-p/q`.
`a - b` is the same as `a + (-b)`.

*   **Example:** Subtract 5/6 from 1/3.
    *   1/3 - 5/6 = 1/3 + (-5/6)
    *   LCM of 3 and 6 is 6.
    *   (2/6) + (-5/6) = (2 - 5)/6 = **-3/6** = **-1/2**

### 3. Multiplication
Multiply the numerators with each other and the denominators with each other.
`(a/b) × (c/d) = (a × c) / (b × d)`

*   **Example:** (-3/5) × 7
    *   (-3/5) × (7/1) = (-3 × 7) / (5 × 1) = **-21/5**

### 4. Division
To divide one rational number by another, multiply the first number by the **reciprocal** of the second. The reciprocal of `c/d` is `d/c`.
`(a/b) ÷ (c/d) = (a/b) × (d/c)`

*   **Example:** (-4/9) ÷ (2/3)
    *   (-4/9) × (3/2)  *(Reciprocal of 2/3 is 3/2)*
    *   (-4 × 3) / (9 × 2) = -12/18
    *   Simplifying gives **-2/3**.

## Summary

*   All integers and fractions are rational numbers.
*   Rational numbers can be positive, negative, or zero.
*   To simplify a rational number, we reduce it to its **standard form** by dividing the numerator and denominator by their HCF.
*   We can represent rational numbers on a **number line**.
*   To compare, add, or subtract rational numbers, we first make their denominators equal by finding the **LCM**.
*   Multiplication involves multiplying numerators and denominators separately.
*   Division involves multiplying by the **reciprocal** of the divisor.
