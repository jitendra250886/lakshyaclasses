# Chapter 4: Simple Equations

## 1. Introduction to Equations

In mathematics, we often use letters to represent unknown numbers. These letters are called **variables**. An **equation** is a statement of equality that involves one or more variables. It's like a weighing balance where the two sides are equal.

### What is a Variable?
A variable is a quantity that does not have a fixed value. It can vary. We use letters like `x`, `y`, `p`, `m`, etc., to represent variables.

### What is an Expression?
An expression is a combination of variables and constants connected by mathematical operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (×), and division (÷).
*   **Example:** `4x + 7`, `10y - 20`

### What is an Equation?
An equation has an **equals sign (=)** between two expressions. The value of the expression on the Left Hand Side (LHS) is equal to the value of the expression on the Right Hand Side (RHS).

*   **Example:** `4x + 7 = 15`
    *   LHS: `4x + 7`
    *   RHS: `15`

An equation is only true for a specific value of the variable. This specific value is called the **solution** of the equation.

## 2. Setting up an Equation

We can translate real-life problems or statements into mathematical equations. This is the first step towards finding a solution.

### From Statements to Equations

Let's see how to convert statements into equations.

| Statement | Equation |
| :--- | :--- |
| The sum of a number `x` and 4 is 9. | `x + 4 = 9` |
| 7 times `m` plus 7 gets you 77. | `7m + 7 = 77` |
| If you take away 6 from 6 times `y`, you get 60. | `6y - 6 = 60` |
| One-fourth of a number `x` minus 4 gives 4. | `(x/4) - 4 = 4` |
| Raju's father's age is 5 years more than 3 times Raju's age (`x`). His father is 44 years old. | `3x + 5 = 44` |

## 3. Solving an Equation

Solving an equation means finding the value of the variable that makes the equation true (i.e., makes LHS = RHS). This value is the solution.

There are two common methods to solve an equation.

### The Balancing Method

Think of an equation as a weighing balance. To keep it balanced, whatever mathematical operation you perform on one side, you must also perform on the other side.

**Goal:** Isolate the variable on one side of the equation.

**Example 1: Solve `y - 5 = 10`**
1.  We want to isolate `y`. To remove `-5` from the LHS, we add 5.
2.  To keep the equation balanced, we must also add 5 to the RHS.
    `y - 5 + 5 = 10 + 5`
    `y = 15`
    So, the solution is `y = 15`.

**Example 2: Solve `4m = 28`**
1.  Here, `m` is multiplied by 4. To isolate `m`, we need to divide by 4.
2.  To keep the equation balanced, we must also divide the RHS by 4.
    `4m / 4 = 28 / 4`
    `m = 7`
    So, the solution is `m = 7`.

### The Transposing Method

Transposing is a shortcut for the balancing method. When you move a number or variable from one side of the equation to the other, you change its operation to the opposite.

*   Addition `(+)` becomes Subtraction `(-)`
*   Subtraction `(-)` becomes Addition `(+)`
*   Multiplication `(×)` becomes Division `(÷)`
*   Division `(÷)` becomes Multiplication `(×)`

**Example 1: Solve `3p - 10 = 5`**
1.  **Transpose -10** from the LHS to the RHS. It will become `+10`.
    `3p = 5 + 10`
    `3p = 15`
2.  Now, `3` is multiplying `p`. **Transpose 3** from the LHS to the RHS. It will become division.
    `p = 15 / 3`
    `p = 5`
    So, the solution is `p = 5`.

**Example 2: Solve `(x/2) + 3 = 8`**
1.  **Transpose +3** from the LHS to the RHS. It will become `-3`.
    `x/2 = 8 - 3`
    `x/2 = 5`
2.  Now, `x` is divided by `2`. **Transpose 2** from the LHS to the RHS. It will become multiplication.
    `x = 5 × 2`
    `x = 10`
    So, the solution is `x = 10`.

## 4. Applications of Simple Equations

Simple equations help us solve day-to-day problems and puzzles.

### Solving Word Problems

Follow these steps to solve word problems:
1.  **Read** the problem carefully and identify what you need to find.
2.  **Represent** the unknown quantity with a variable (like `x`).
3.  **Form** an equation based on the information given in the problem.
4.  **Solve** the equation to find the value of the variable.
5.  **Check** your answer by putting it back into the problem statement.

**Example:**
*Problem:* The sum of three consecutive integers is 51. What are the integers?

1.  **Unknown:** We need to find three consecutive integers.
2.  **Represent:** Let the first integer be `x`.
    Then the second integer is `x + 1`.
    And the third integer is `x + 2`.
3.  **Form Equation:** The sum of these three is 51.
    `x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 51`
4.  **Solve:**
    `3x + 3 = 51`
    `3x = 51 - 3` (Transposing 3)
    `3x = 48`
    `x = 48 / 3` (Transposing 3)
    `x = 16`
5.  **Answer:**
    *   First integer = `x` = **16**
    *   Second integer = `x + 1` = **17**
    *   Third integer = `x + 2` = **18**

*Check:* 16 + 17 + 18 = 51. The answer is correct.

## Summary

*   An **equation** is a condition on a variable, stating that two expressions are equal (LHS = RHS).
*   The value of the variable for which the equation is satisfied is called the **solution** of the equation.
*   To set up an equation, we translate a word problem or statement into a mathematical form.
*   An equation can be solved by performing the same mathematical operation on both sides to isolate the variable (**Balancing Method**).
*   A quicker way to solve is by moving terms to the other side of the equation and changing their sign/operation (**Transposing Method**).
*   Simple equations are widely used to solve practical problems in various fields.
