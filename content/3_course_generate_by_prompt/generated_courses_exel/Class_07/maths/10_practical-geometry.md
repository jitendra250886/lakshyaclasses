# Chapter 10: Practical Geometry

## Introduction

Practical Geometry is a branch of mathematics where we learn to draw shapes, angles, and lines accurately. Unlike drawing a rough sketch, these constructions use specific tools and follow a logical, step-by-step process to create precise geometrical figures.

In this chapter, we will learn how to construct parallel lines and various types of triangles using a ruler, compass, and protractor.

### Tools for Construction

To perform these constructions, you will need a geometry box with the following tools:

| Tool | Usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Ruler** | To draw line segments and measure their lengths. |
| **Compass** | To draw arcs and circles of a specific radius. |
| **Protractor** | To measure and draw angles. |
| **Set-squares** | To draw perpendicular and parallel lines. |
| **Divider** | To compare the lengths of line segments. |

## 1. Construction of a Line Parallel to a Given Line

We can construct a line parallel to a given line through a point not on the line. This construction is based on the property that if a transversal intersects two lines such that the **alternate interior angles** are equal, then the two lines are parallel.

**Problem:** Draw a line parallel to a given line `l` through a point `A` not on `l`.

**Steps of Construction:**

1.  **Step 1:** Draw a line `l` and mark a point `A` outside it.
2.  **Step 2:** Take any point `B` on the line `l` and join `A` to `B`.
3.  **Step 3:** With `B` as the center and a convenient radius, draw an arc cutting `l` at `C` and `AB` at `D`.
4.  **Step 4:** Now, with `A` as the center and the **same radius** as in Step 3, draw an arc `EF` cutting `AB` at `G`.
5.  **Step 5:** Place the pointed tip of the compass at `C` and adjust the opening so that the pencil tip is at `D`.
6.  **Step 6:** With the same opening as in Step 5, and with `G` as the center, draw an arc cutting the arc `EF` at `H`.
7.  **Step 7:** Join `A` to `H` to draw a line `m`.

The line `m` is the required line parallel to `l`. Here, `∠HAB` and `∠ABC` are alternate interior angles and are equal by construction.

## 2. Construction of Triangles

A triangle is a closed figure made of three line segments. We can construct a unique triangle if we know certain combinations of its sides and angles.

### i. SSS Criterion (Side-Side-Side)

You can construct a unique triangle if the lengths of all three sides are known.

**Condition:** The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side (Triangle Inequality Property).

**Problem:** Construct a triangle `ABC` where `AB = 5 cm`, `BC = 6 cm`, and `AC = 7 cm`.

**Steps of Construction:**

1.  **Step 1:** Draw a line segment `BC` of length 6 cm.
2.  **Step 2:** From point `B`, with a radius of 5 cm (length of AB), draw an arc.
3.  **Step 3:** From point `C`, with a radius of 7 cm (length of AC), draw another arc that intersects the first arc.
4.  **Step 4:** Mark the point of intersection of the two arcs as `A`.
5.  **Step 5:** Join `AB` and `AC`.

`△ABC` is the required triangle.



### ii. SAS Criterion (Side-Angle-Side)

You can construct a unique triangle if the lengths of two sides and the measure of the **included angle** (the angle between these two sides) are known.

**Problem:** Construct a triangle `PQR` where `PQ = 3 cm`, `QR = 5.5 cm`, and `∠PQR = 60°`.

**Steps of Construction:**

1.  **Step 1:** Draw a line segment `QR` of length 5.5 cm.
2.  **Step 2:** At point `Q`, use a protractor or compass to construct an angle of 60°. Let the ray be `QX`.
3.  **Step 3:** With `Q` as the center and a radius of 3 cm (length of PQ), draw an arc cutting the ray `QX`.
4.  **Step 4:** Mark the point of intersection as `P`.
5.  **Step 5:** Join `PR`.

`△PQR` is the required triangle.



### iii. ASA Criterion (Angle-Side-Angle)

You can construct a unique triangle if the measures of two angles and the length of the **included side** (the side between these two angles) are known.

**Problem:** Construct a triangle `XYZ` where `XY = 6 cm`, `∠ZXY = 30°`, and `∠XYZ = 100°`.

**Steps of Construction:**

1.  **Step 1:** Draw a line segment `XY` of length 6 cm.
2.  **Step 2:** At point `X`, use a protractor to draw an angle of 30°. Let the ray be `XA`.
3.  **Step 3:** At point `Y`, use a protractor to draw an angle of 100°. Let the ray be `YB`.
4.  **Step 4:** The two rays `XA` and `YB` will intersect at a point. Mark this point as `Z`.

`△XYZ` is the required triangle.



### iv. RHS Criterion (Right angle-Hypotenuse-Side)

You can construct a unique right-angled triangle if the length of the **hypotenuse** and one other side are known.

-   **R:** Right angle (90°)
-   **H:** Hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle)
-   **S:** One of the other two sides

**Problem:** Construct a triangle `LMN`, right-angled at `M`, where `LN = 5 cm` and `MN = 3 cm`.

**Steps of Construction:**

1.  **Step 1:** Draw a line segment `MN` of length 3 cm.
2.  **Step 2:** At point `M`, construct a right angle (90°). Let the ray be `MX`.
3.  **Step 3:** With `N` as the center and a radius of 5 cm (length of the hypotenuse LN), draw an arc that cuts the ray `MX`.
4.  **Step 4:** Mark the point of intersection as `L`.
5.  **Step 5:** Join `LN`.

`△LMN` is the required right-angled triangle.

## Summary

This chapter teaches the fundamental methods of constructing geometric figures with precision. We learned to:
-   Construct a line parallel to a given line using the property of equal alternate interior angles.
-   Construct a unique triangle using four different criteria:
    1.  **SSS:** When all three sides are known.
    2.  **SAS:** When two sides and the included angle are known.
    3.  **ASA:** When two angles and the included side are known.
    4.  **RHS:** For a right-angled triangle, when the hypotenuse and one side are known.
