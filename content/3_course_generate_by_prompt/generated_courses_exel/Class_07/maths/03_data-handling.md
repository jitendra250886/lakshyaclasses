# Chapter 3: Data Handling

## Introduction to Data

Data is a collection of facts, such as numbers, words, measurements, observations, or just descriptions of things. For example, the marks you scored in your last five math tests (e.g., 85, 92, 78, 95, 88) are data. The heights of students in your class are also data.

**Why do we handle data?**
We collect and organize data to study it and draw meaningful conclusions. This process is called **Data Handling**.

## 1. Collecting and Organizing Data

The first step in data handling is collecting data. After collection, we need to organize it in a systematic way to make it easier to understand.

### Frequency Distribution Table

A common way to organize data is by using a **Frequency Distribution Table**. Frequency is the number of times a particular observation occurs in the data.

**Example:** The marks obtained by 20 students in a science test (out of 10) are:
`8, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 7, 8, 5, 9, 9, 8, 7, 10, 8, 9, 8, 7, 6, 8`

To organize this, we can create a frequency table using **Tally Marks**.

| Marks | Tally Marks | Frequency (No. of Students) |
| :---- | :---------- | :-------------------------- |
| 5     | \|\|        | 2                           |
| 6     | \|          | 1                           |
| 7     | \|\|\|      | 4                           |
| 8     | \|\|\|\| \|\|  | 7                           |
| 9     | \|\|\|\|      | 4                           |
| 10    | \|\|        | 2                           |
| **Total** |             | **20**                      |

This table clearly shows how many students got each score. For instance, 7 students scored 8 marks.

## 2. Representative Values (Measures of Central Tendency)

A representative value is a single value that describes the central characteristic of the entire set of data. The three main measures of central tendency are Mean, Median, and Mode.

### a) Arithmetic Mean (Average)

The mean is the most common representative value. It is calculated by dividing the sum of all observations by the number of observations.

**Formula:**
`Mean = (Sum of all observations) / (Number of observations)`

**Example:** A cricketer scored the following runs in 6 innings: 36, 35, 50, 46, 60, 55.
-   **Sum of runs** = 36 + 35 + 50 + 46 + 60 + 55 = 282
-   **Number of innings** = 6
-   **Mean score** = 282 / 6 = 47 runs

### b) Mode

The mode of a set of observations is the observation that occurs most often.

**Example 1:** Find the mode of the scores: `1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 4`
-   The number 1 occurs 3 times.
-   The number 2 occurs 4 times.
-   The numbers 3 and 4 occur less frequently.
-   Since 2 occurs the most number of times (4 times), the **Mode = 2**.

**Example 2 (Large Data):** Use the frequency table from the previous section. The mark '8' has the highest frequency (7). Therefore, the mode of the marks is 8.

### c) Median

The median is the middle value of the data when it is arranged in ascending (or descending) order. It divides the data into two equal halves.

**How to find the Median:**
1.  Arrange the data in ascending order.
2.  Find the middle value.
    *   **If the number of observations (n) is odd:** The median is the middle observation.
    *   **If the number of observations (n) is even:** The median is the average of the two middle observations.

**Example 1 (Odd number of observations):**
Find the median of the heights (in cm): `154, 156, 155, 160, 158, 152, 153`
1.  **Arrange in ascending order:** `152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 158, 160`
2.  There are 7 observations (odd). The middle value is the 4th one.
3.  **Median = 155 cm**.

**Example 2 (Even number of observations):**
Find the median of the scores: `4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14`
1.  The data is already in ascending order.
2.  There are 6 observations (even). The two middle values are the 3rd (8) and 4th (10).
3.  **Median** = (8 + 10) / 2 = 18 / 2 = **9**.

## 3. Use of Bar Graphs

A bar graph is a pictorial representation of data using bars of uniform width. The height of the bars represents the frequency of the data.

### Double Bar Graph

A double bar graph is used to compare two sets of data on the same graph. For example, comparing the marks of a student in the first and second term.

**Example:** A double bar graph showing the favorite sports of boys and girls in a class.



**How to interpret this graph?**
-   The graph compares the preferences of boys and girls.
-   Cricket is the most popular sport among boys.
-   Badminton is the most popular sport among girls.
-   We can easily see the difference in preference for each sport between the two groups.

## 4. Chance and Probability

### Chance

Chance is the possibility of something happening. We often use words like:
-   **Certain:** An event that will definitely happen (e.g., The sun rising from the east).
-   **Impossible:** An event that can never happen (e.g., A dog flying in the sky).
-   **Can happen but not certain (Possible):** An event that may or may not happen (e.g., It will rain tomorrow).

### Probability

Probability is a measure of how likely an event is to occur. It is expressed as a number between 0 and 1.
-   Probability of an impossible event is 0.
-   Probability of a certain event is 1.

**Formula:**
`Probability of an event = (Number of favourable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)`

**Example:** What is the probability of getting a '4' when a standard die is rolled once?
-   A standard die has 6 faces, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
-   **Total number of possible outcomes** = 6
-   We want to get a '4'. The number of outcomes where we get a '4' is just one.
-   **Number of favourable outcomes** = 1
-   **Probability (getting a 4)** = 1 / 6

**Example 2:** A coin is tossed. What is the probability of getting a Head?
-   **Total outcomes:** Head (H), Tail (T). So, total is 2.
-   **Favourable outcome:** Head. So, number is 1.
-   **Probability (getting a Head)** = 1 / 2

## Summary

-   **Data** is a collection of facts or figures. We organize it to extract information.
-   **Frequency** is the number of times a particular observation occurs.
-   **Mean (Average)** is the sum of all observations divided by the number of observations.
-   **Mode** is the observation that occurs most frequently.
-   **Median** is the middle value when data is arranged in ascending or descending order.
-   **Bar Graphs** are used to represent data visually, with **Double Bar Graphs** used for comparing two data sets.
-   **Probability** measures the likelihood of an event happening and is calculated as the ratio of favourable outcomes to total possible outcomes.
