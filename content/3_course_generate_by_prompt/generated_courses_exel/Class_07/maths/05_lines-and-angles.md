# Chapter 5: Lines and Angles

## Introduction to Basic Terms

Before we dive into the properties of lines and angles, let's refresh some basic definitions.

-   **Line:** A straight path that extends in both directions without end. It has no endpoints. We denote it as $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$.
-   **Line Segment:** A part of a line that has two distinct endpoints. We denote it as $\overline{AB}$.
-   **Ray:** A part of a line that has one endpoint and extends infinitely in one direction. We denote it as $\overrightarrow{AB}$.
-   **Angle:** An angle is formed when two lines or rays meet at a common endpoint, called the **vertex**. The two rays forming the angle are called its **arms** or **sides**. We measure angles in degrees (°).

## Related Angles

Angles can be related to each other in several ways. Understanding these relationships is key to solving geometry problems.

### 1. Complementary Angles

Two angles are **complementary** if the sum of their measures is **90°**. Each angle is called the "complement" of the other.

-   **Example:** An angle of 30° and an angle of 60° are complementary because 30° + 60° = 90°.
-   The complement of 40° is (90° - 40°) = 50°.

### 2. Supplementary Angles

Two angles are **supplementary** if the sum of their measures is **180°**. Each angle is called the "supplement" of the other.

-   **Example:** An angle of 110° and an angle of 70° are supplementary because 110° + 70° = 180°.
-   The supplement of 80° is (180° - 80°) = 100°.

### 3. Adjacent Angles

Two angles are **adjacent** if they satisfy three conditions:
1.  They have a **common vertex**.
2.  They have a **common arm**.
3.  Their non-common arms are on opposite sides of the common arm.


*In the figure, ∠ABD and ∠DBC are adjacent angles.*

### 4. Linear Pair

A **linear pair** is a pair of adjacent angles whose non-common sides are opposite rays (i.e., they form a straight line).
-   The sum of the angles in a linear pair is always **180°**.
-   Therefore, angles in a linear pair are always supplementary.


*∠1 and ∠2 form a linear pair. So, ∠1 + ∠2 = 180°.*

### 5. Vertically Opposite Angles

When two lines intersect, they form four angles. The angles that are opposite to each other are called **vertically opposite angles**.
-   Vertically opposite angles are always **equal**.


*In this figure, ∠1 and ∠3 are vertically opposite angles, so ∠1 = ∠3. Similarly, ∠2 and ∠4 are vertically opposite angles, so ∠2 = ∠4.*

## Pairs of Lines

### 1. Intersecting Lines

Two lines that meet or cross each other at a single common point are called **intersecting lines**.

### 2. Transversal

A **transversal** is a line that intersects two or more lines at distinct points.


*Here, line 't' is a transversal to lines 'l' and 'm'.*

### Angles made by a Transversal

When a transversal intersects two lines, it forms eight angles. These angles have special names and relationships.

| Angle Type | Description | Angle Pairs in the Figure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Interior Angles** | Angles that lie between the two lines. | ∠3, ∠4, ∠5, ∠6 |
| **Exterior Angles** | Angles that lie outside the two lines. | ∠1, ∠2, ∠7, ∠8 |
| **Corresponding Angles** | Angles in the same relative position at each intersection. | ∠1 & ∠5, ∠2 & ∠6, ∠3 & ∠7, ∠4 & ∠8 |
| **Alternate Interior Angles** | A pair of interior angles on opposite sides of the transversal. | ∠3 & ∠6, ∠4 & ∠5 |
| **Alternate Exterior Angles** | A pair of exterior angles on opposite sides of the transversal. | ∠1 & ∠8, ∠2 & ∠7 |
| **Interior angles on the same side of the transversal** | A pair of interior angles on the same side of the transversal. | ∠3 & ∠5, ∠4 & ∠6 |

## Transversal of Parallel Lines

When a transversal intersects two **parallel lines**, the angle pairs have special properties.

If lines **l || m** (line l is parallel to line m), then:

1.  **Each pair of corresponding angles is equal.**
    -   ∠1 = ∠5, ∠2 = ∠6, ∠3 = ∠7, ∠4 = ∠8

2.  **Each pair of alternate interior angles is equal.**
    -   ∠3 = ∠6, ∠4 = ∠5

3.  **Each pair of interior angles on the same side of the transversal is supplementary.**
    -   ∠3 + ∠5 = 180°, ∠4 + ∠6 = 180°

## Checking for Parallel Lines

We can use the converse of the above properties to check if two lines are parallel.

Two lines are **parallel** if a transversal intersects them and any of the following conditions are true:

1.  A pair of **corresponding angles** is equal.
2.  A pair of **alternate interior angles** is equal.
3.  A pair of **interior angles on the same side of the transversal** is supplementary (adds up to 180°).

## Summary

-   **Complementary Angles:** Sum is 90°.
-   **Supplementary Angles:** Sum is 180°.
-   **Linear Pair:** Adjacent angles on a straight line, sum is 180°.
-   **Vertically Opposite Angles:** Formed by intersecting lines, are always equal.
-   When a transversal cuts two **parallel lines**:
    -   Corresponding angles are equal.
    -   Alternate interior angles are equal.
    -   Interior angles on the same side are supplementary.
-   If any of the above conditions are met, the lines are parallel.
