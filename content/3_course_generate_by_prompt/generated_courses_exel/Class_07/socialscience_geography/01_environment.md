# Environment (Class 7, Geography)

## What is Environment?

The word 'environment' means our surroundings. Everything we see around us—the place, people, things, and nature—collectively forms the environment. It is our basic life support system. It provides the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, and the land where we live.

The environment is a combination of both **natural** and **human-made** phenomena.
*   **Natural Environment**: Refers to both biotic (living, e.g., plants, animals) and abiotic (non-living, e.g., land, water) conditions that exist on the earth.
*   **Human-Made Environment**: Includes the activities, creations, and interactions among human beings.

## Components of Environment

The environment can be broadly classified into three main components.

| Component | Description | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Natural** | All gifts of nature. | Land (Lithosphere), Water (Hydrosphere), Air (Atmosphere), Living things (Biosphere). |
| **Human-Made** | Things created by humans. | Buildings, parks, bridges, roads, industries, monuments. |
| **Human** | Humans themselves and their social structures. | Individual, family, community, religion, education, economy, political situation. |

### 1. Natural Environment

The natural environment comprises land, water, air, plants, and animals. It is further divided into four major domains or realms.

#### Lithosphere
*   The lithosphere is the solid crust or the hard top layer of the Earth.
*   It is made up of rocks and minerals and is covered by a thin layer of soil.
*   It is an irregular surface with various landforms such as mountains, plateaus, plains, and valleys.
*   This domain provides us with forests, grasslands for grazing, land for agriculture, and human settlements. It is also a source of mineral wealth.

#### Hydrosphere
*   The hydrosphere is the domain of water.
*   It comprises various sources of water and different types of water bodies like rivers, lakes, seas, oceans, etc.
*   It is essential for all living organisms.

#### Atmosphere
*   The atmosphere is the thin layer of air that surrounds the Earth.
*   It consists of a number of gases (like oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide), dust, and water vapour.
*   The gravitational force of the Earth holds the atmosphere around it.
*   It protects us from the harmful rays and scorching heat of the sun. Changes in the atmosphere produce changes in the weather and climate.

#### Biosphere
*   The biosphere is the narrow zone of the Earth where land, water, and air interact with each other to support life.
*   It is also known as the living world.
*   The plant and animal kingdom together make up the biosphere.

### 2. Human-Made Environment

Human beings interact with the natural environment and modify it according to their needs. These modifications and creations by humans form the human-made environment.
*   **Examples:** Buildings, roads, bridges, parks, industries, monuments, etc.
*   Early humans adapted themselves to their natural surroundings, but with time, their needs grew. They learned new ways to use and change the environment.

### 3. Human Environment

This refers to humans themselves and their creations like family, society, and other systems.
*   It includes the individual, family, community, and larger groups.
*   It also includes social structures like religion, educational systems, economic activities (like trade and commerce), and political situations.

## What is an Ecosystem?

An ecosystem is a system formed by the interaction of all living organisms with each other and with the physical and chemical factors of the environment in which they live. All living things are linked by the transfer of energy and material.

*   **Interdependence:** All plants, animals, and human beings depend on their immediate surroundings and on each other.
*   **Examples:** An ecosystem can be as large as a vast rainforest, grassland, desert, or ocean, or as small as a pond or a lake. For instance, in a pond ecosystem, fish, frogs, algae, and water lilies all interact with the non-living components like water, sunlight, and soil at the bottom.

## Human-Environment Interaction

Human beings are an integral part of the environment, but they are also the ones who can modify it.

*   **Early Humans:** They adapted to the natural surroundings. They led a simple life and fulfilled their requirements directly from the nature around them.
*   **Growth and Change:** With time, human needs grew and became more varied. Humans learned new ways to use and change the environment. They learned to:
    *   Grow crops (agriculture).
    *   Domesticate animals.
    *   Lead a settled life.
*   **Major Developments:**
    *   The invention of the **wheel**.
    *   Production of surplus food.
    *   The **barter system** emerged, where goods were exchanged without the use of money.
    *   Trade and commerce developed.
    *   The **Industrial Revolution** in the 18th century enabled large-scale production.
    *   Transportation and communication became faster and easier.

Humans must learn to live and use their environment in a harmonious way. A perfect balance is necessary between the natural and human environment to ensure the planet's sustainability.

## Summary

The environment is everything that surrounds us, including natural and human-made elements. The natural environment is divided into four domains: Lithosphere (land), Hydrosphere (water), Atmosphere (air), and Biosphere (life). Humans interact with this environment, modifying it to create a human-made environment (e.g., buildings, roads) and a human environment (e.g., family, community). An ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with their non-living environment. Over time, human interaction with the environment has evolved from simple adaptation to significant modification, highlighting the need for a sustainable balance.
