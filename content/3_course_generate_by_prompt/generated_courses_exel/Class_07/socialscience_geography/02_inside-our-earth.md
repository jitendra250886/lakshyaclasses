# Chapter 2: Inside Our Earth

## Introduction

Just like an onion, the Earth is made up of several concentric layers with one inside another. Understanding these layers helps us comprehend various natural phenomena like earthquakes and volcanoes. This chapter explores the interior of our planet, the materials it's made of (rocks and minerals), and the processes that continually shape it.

## Interior of the Earth

The Earth's interior is primarily divided into three main layers: the **Crust**, the **Mantle**, and the **Core**.



### 1. The Crust
The **crust** is the uppermost and thinnest layer of the Earth's surface.

*   **Thickness:** It is about 35 km thick on the continental masses and only 5 km thick on the ocean floors.
*   **Composition:**
    *   **Continental Crust:** Mainly consists of silica and alumina. It is thus called **sial** (si-silica and al-alumina).
    *   **Oceanic Crust:** Mainly consists of silica and magnesium. It is therefore called **sima** (si-silica and ma-magnesium).

### 2. The Mantle
The **mantle** is the layer found just beneath the crust.

*   **Thickness:** It extends up to a depth of 2900 km below the crust.
*   **State:** It is in a semi-molten state, known as magma.

### 3. The Core
The **core** is the innermost layer of the Earth.

*   **Radius:** It has a radius of about 3500 km.
*   **Composition:** It is mainly made of nickel and iron and is called **nife** (ni – nickel and fe – ferrous i.e. iron).
*   **Characteristics:** The central core has very high temperature and pressure. It is divided into two parts:
    *   **Outer Core:** Is in a liquid state.
    *   **Inner Core:** Is in a solid state due to extreme pressure.

| Layer   | Thickness/Radius | Main Minerals             | Key Characteristics                               |
| :------ | :--------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **Crust** | 5-35 km          | Sial (continents) & Sima (oceans) | Outermost, thinnest, and solid layer.             |
| **Mantle**  | 2900 km          | Silicates                 | Located below the crust, semi-molten (magma).     |
| **Core**    | 3500 km          | Nife (Nickel & Iron)      | Innermost layer, very high temperature & pressure. |

## Rocks and Minerals

The Earth's crust is made up of various types of rocks. A **rock** is any natural mass of mineral matter that makes up the earth’s crust. Rocks can be of different colours, sizes, and textures.

There are three major types of rocks:
1.  Igneous Rocks
2.  Sedimentary Rocks
3.  Metamorphic Rocks

### 1. Igneous Rocks
When the molten magma from the Earth's mantle cools, it becomes solid. Rocks formed in this way are called **igneous rocks**. They are also called primary rocks.

There are two types of igneous rocks:
*   **Extrusive Igneous Rocks:** When molten lava (magma that reaches the surface) comes on the earth’s surface, it rapidly cools down and becomes solid. Rocks formed in such a way are called extrusive igneous rocks. They have a very fine-grained structure.
    *   **Example:** Basalt. The Deccan plateau is made of basalt rocks.
*   **Intrusive Igneous Rocks:** Sometimes the molten magma cools down deep inside the earth’s crust. Solid rocks so formed are called intrusive igneous rocks. Since they cool down slowly, they form large grains.
    *   **Example:** Granite. Grinding stones used to prepare paste/powder of spices and grains are made of granite.

### 2. Sedimentary Rocks
Rocks roll down, crack, and hit each other and are broken down into small fragments. These smaller particles are called **sediments**. These sediments are transported and deposited by wind, water, etc. These loose sediments are compressed and hardened to form layers of rocks. These types of rocks are called **sedimentary rocks**.

*   **Characteristics:** They are often found in layers and may contain **fossils** (the remains of dead plants and animals trapped in the layers of rocks).
*   **Examples:** Sandstone (made from grains of sand), Limestone.

### 3. Metamorphic Rocks
When igneous and sedimentary rocks are subjected to great heat and pressure, they change their form and character. These changed rocks are called **metamorphic rocks**.

*   **Examples:**
    *   Clay changes into **slate**.
    *   Limestone changes into **marble**.

## The Rock Cycle

The process of transformation of the rock from one type to another is known as the **rock cycle**. It is a continuous process.

1.  Molten **magma** cools and solidifies to become **igneous rock**.
2.  **Igneous rocks** are broken down into small particles (sediments) by weathering and erosion.
3.  These **sediments** are transported and deposited to form **sedimentary rock**.
4.  When the **igneous and sedimentary rocks** are subjected to heat and pressure, they change into **metamorphic rock**.
5.  The **metamorphic rocks**, which are still under great heat and pressure, melt down to form molten **magma**.
6.  This molten **magma** can again cool down and solidify into **igneous rock**, and the cycle continues.

## Uses of Rocks and Minerals

Rocks and minerals are very useful to us.
*   **Construction:** Hard rocks are used for making roads, houses, and buildings (e.g., granite, marble, sandstone).
*   **Games:** Stones are used in many games, like seven stones (pitthoo), hopscotch (stapu/kit-kit).
*   **Monuments:** Many historical monuments are made of rock. For example, the Red Fort is made of red sandstone and the Taj Mahal is made of white marble.
*   **Fuels:** Minerals like coal, natural gas, and petroleum are vital sources of energy.
*   **Industries:** Minerals like iron, aluminium, gold, and uranium are used in various industries.
*   **Fertilizers:** Certain minerals are used in the production of fertilizers for agriculture.

## Summary

The Earth is composed of three main layers: the crust, mantle, and core. The crust is made of different types of rocks, which are broadly classified as igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. These rocks are not permanent and continuously change from one form to another through a process called the rock cycle. Rocks and the minerals they contain are essential resources used in construction, industry, and as fuel.
