*   **"गोपी दही मथत, सुनियत हैं कंगना के झनकारे॥"**

    She urges her dear son to get up, telling him that gods (Sur) and humans (Nar) are standing at their door, waiting to get a glimpse (darshan) of him.

*   **"ग्वाल-बाल सब करत कुलाहल, जय-जय सबद उचारै॥"**
    She adds that all his friends, the young cowherds (Gwal-Bal), are making a joyful noise outside, chanting his name and hailing his victory ("Jai-Jai").

*   **"माखन-रोटी हाथ मँह लिनी, गउवन के रखवारे।"**
