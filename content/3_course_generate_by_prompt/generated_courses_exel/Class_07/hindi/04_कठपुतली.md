# Chapter 4: कठपुतली

## Introduction to the Poet

The poem "कठपुतली" (Kathputli) is written by the renowned poet **श्री भवानीप्रसाद मिश्र (Shri Bhavani Prasad Mishra)**. In this poem, he uses the puppet as a metaphor to beautifully express the desire for freedom and the sense of responsibility that comes with it.

## Stanza-wise Explanation (पद और व्याख्या)

This poem revolves around a puppet that suddenly feels a strong urge to be independent.

### Stanza 1

> कठपुतली गुस्से से उबली
> बोली- ये धागे
> क्यों हैं मेरे पीछे-आगे?
> इन्हें तोड़ दो;
> मुझे मेरे पाँवों पर छोड़ दो।

**Explanation:**
The poem begins with a puppet that is "boiling with anger" (गुस्से से उबली). She is tired of being controlled by the threads attached to her body. She questions why these threads are all around her, dictating her every move. In a burst of anger and frustration, she demands that these threads be broken. She expresses a powerful desire to be free and to stand on her own feet (मुझे मेरे पाँवों पर छोड़ दो), which symbolizes her wish for independence and self-reliance.

### Stanza 2

> सुनकर बोलीं और-और
> कठपुतलियाँ
> कि हाँ,
> बहुत दिन हुए
> हमें अपने मन के छंद छुए।

**Explanation:**
When the other puppets hear the first puppet's bold declaration, they are inspired. They all agree with her and voice their support. They say, "Yes, it has been a very long time since we have done anything according to our own will" (हमें अपने मन के छंद छुए). This line means they haven't felt true happiness or lived life on their own terms for a long time. The first puppet's words ignite the same desire for freedom in them.

### Stanza 3

> मगर...
> पहली कठपुतली सोचने लगी-
> ये कैसी इच्छा
> मेरे मन में जगी?

**Explanation:**
However, when the first puppet sees that all the other puppets are ready to join her rebellion, she suddenly becomes thoughtful and hesitant. The word "मगर..." (But...) marks a shift in her mood from anger to contemplation. She realizes the immense responsibility that has fallen upon her shoulders. The freedom of all the other puppets now depends on her. She starts to question her own desire: "What kind of wish is this that has arisen in my mind?" (ये कैसी इच्छा मेरे मन में जगी?). She wonders if she has thought through the consequences of freedom. Can they all survive without the support of the threads? This stanza highlights the important idea that freedom comes with great responsibility.

## Central Idea of the Poem (कविता का सार)

The poem "कठपुतली" is a profound reflection on the concept of freedom.

1.  **Desire for Independence:** The central theme is the universal desire for freedom. The puppet, symbolizing a dependent person, yearns to break free from the control of others.
2.  **The Burden of Responsibility:** The poem beautifully illustrates that the idea of freedom is appealing, but the reality comes with immense responsibility. When the first puppet realizes that others are counting on her, she is forced to think about the practicalities and consequences of her wish.
3.  **Thoughtful Action:** The poem suggests that one must think carefully before making a significant decision, especially when it affects others. The first puppet's initial outburst was emotional, but her final thoughts are rational and cautious.
