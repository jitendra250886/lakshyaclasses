**Explanation:**
The poet imagines a mountain as a farmer who is sitting down.
*   **आकाश का साफ़ा बाँधकर (Wearing the sky as a turban):** The sky above the mountain looks like a turban (साफ़ा) tied on the farmer's (mountain's) head.
*   **सूरज की चिलम खींचता (Smoking a pipe of the sun):** The setting sun, with its reddish-orange glow, looks like a lit *chilam* (a traditional clay pipe) that the farmer is smoking.
*   **घुटनों पर पड़ी है नदी चादर-सी (A river like a sheet on his knees):** A river flowing at the foot of the mountain appears like a white sheet (चादर) spread over the farmer's knees.
*   **पलाश के जंगल की अँगीठी (A fire of Palash flowers):** The nearby forest of Palash trees, with its bright red flowers, looks like a burning brazier (अँगीठी) providing warmth.

In this stanza, the poet creates a static, peaceful scene of a winter evening.

### Stanza 2

**Original Hindi:**
> अंधकार दूर पूर्व में
> सिमटा बैठा है भेड़ों के गल्ले-सा।

*   **जैसे किसी ने आवाज़ दी - ‘सुनते हो’ (As if someone called out - 'Are you listening?'):** The peacock's call sounds like someone is calling out to the farmer, breaking his meditative state.
*   **चिलम औंधी, धुआँ उठा (The pipe overturned, smoke rose):** This call startles the farmer (the evening). The *chilam* (the sun) overturns.
*   **सूरज डूबा, अँधेरा छा गया (The sun set, darkness spread):** As the sun sets, a wisp of smoke (a faint light) rises, and then darkness spreads everywhere, marking the arrival of night. The peaceful scene of the evening comes to an end.
