## Character Sketch of Dadi Ma

Dadi Ma is the central character of the story. She was not just an elderly member of the family but its very foundation.

-   **Knowledgeable:** She had extensive knowledge of traditional home remedies for various illnesses. Villagers often sought her advice for ailments.
-   **Strict but Kind-hearted:** On the surface, she appeared strict and would often scold people, like she did with Rammi's aunt (Dhanno) for not repaying a loan. However, beneath this tough exterior was a very kind and compassionate heart. She not only forgave Dhanno's debt but also gave her money for her daughter's wedding.
-   **Strong and Resilient:** After the death of her husband (the author's grandfather), she was deeply saddened but did not let her grief overwhelm her. She remained strong for her family and managed the household affairs with composure.
-   **Selfless and Sacrificial:** During a financial crisis in the family, when the author's father was worried about expenses, Dadi Ma selflessly gave him the last piece of jewelry she had—golden bangles given to her by her late husband. This shows her willingness to sacrifice her personal belongings for the family's well-being.
