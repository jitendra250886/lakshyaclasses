## Plot Summary

### The Arrival of the Peacocks
The story begins with the narrator visiting a bird-seller on the recommendation of a guest. The bird-seller convinces her to buy two peacock chicks, claiming they are a rare breed. Though initially hesitant, she buys them. The chicks are small and look like painted balls of fluff. They are kept in her study, where they soon become comfortable.

### Growing Up and Naming
The chicks grow rapidly into a magnificent peacock and a graceful peahen. The peacock develops a brilliant, iridescent blue neck, which inspires the narrator to name him **Neelkanth**. The peahen, who always follows him like a shadow, is named **Radha**.

### Neelkanth, The Protector
Neelkanth becomes the self-appointed leader and protector of all the animals in the narrator's home, which includes rabbits, pigeons, and a dog. The narrator recounts a specific incident where a snake enters the enclosure and catches a baby rabbit. While other animals panic, Neelkanth bravely attacks the snake with his sharp beak, killing it and saving the rabbit's life. This event solidifies his role as the guardian.

### The Arrival of Kubja
One day, the narrator brings home another peahen with an injured leg. She names her **Kubja**. Unlike Radha, Kubja is ill-tempered and jealous. From the moment she arrives, she tries to come between Neelkanth and Radha.

### Conflict and Tragedy
Kubja's jealousy disrupts the peace of the household. She would attack Radha whenever she saw her near Neelkanth. She was extremely possessive and would not let any other bird or animal come close to him. This constant conflict and hostility deeply sadden Neelkanth. He becomes withdrawn and loses his joy. He stops dancing during the monsoon, which was once his favourite activity.

### The Death of Neelkanth
The constant stress and sadness take a toll on Neelkanth. One morning, the narrator finds him dead, spread out on the ground as if he were a statue. The author believes he died of a broken heart, unable to cope with the constant turmoil caused by Kubja.

### The Aftermath
After Neelkanth's death, Kubja restlessly searches for him, calling out his name. She eventually dies after being attacked by the narrator's dog, Kajli. Radha, on the other hand, continues to wait for Neelkanth's return. She often stands near his favourite tree, calling out for him in a mournful tone, symbolizing her undying love and longing.

## Key Themes

*   **Human-Animal Bond:** The story highlights the deep emotional connection the narrator shares with her pets, especially Neelkanth.
*   **Love and Companionship:** The pure and harmonious relationship between Neelkanth and Radha is a central theme.
*   **Jealousy and its Consequences:** Kubja's character shows how jealousy can destroy peace, happiness, and ultimately lead to tragedy.
*   **Beauty of Nature:** Mahadevi Verma provides vivid and poetic descriptions of the peacocks, their dance, and their surroundings, celebrating the beauty of the natural world.
