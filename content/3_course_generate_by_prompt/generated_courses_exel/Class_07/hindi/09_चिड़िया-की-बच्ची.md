## Character Sketches

1.  **Seth Madhavdas (सेठ माधवदास):** He is a very rich man who owns a magnificent marble mansion and a beautiful garden. Despite having all the worldly comforts, he feels a deep sense of loneliness and emptiness in his life. He is possessive and believes that his wealth can buy him anything, including the bird's companionship. He tries to lure the little bird with temptations to fill the void in his life.

2.  **The Little Bird (चिड़िया की बच्ची):** She is a small, innocent, and cheerful bird. She is unaware of the value of gold, pearls, or a luxurious cage. Her world is simple and filled with the love of her mother, the warmth of her nest, the joy of flying in the open sky, and playing with nature. For her, freedom and her mother's love are the most precious things, far more valuable than any material wealth.

## Plot Summary

The story begins with Seth Madhavdas relaxing in his lush garden, admiring his newly built grand mansion. He has everything one could desire, yet he feels an inner emptiness.

*   **The Bird's Arrival:** A beautiful little bird flies into the garden and sits on a rose bush. Madhavdas is instantly captivated by her beauty, her playful movements, and her sweet chirping.
*   **The Conversation and Temptations:** Madhavdas starts talking to the bird, asking her to stay in his garden forever. He sees her as a way to fill his loneliness.
    *   He offers her a golden cage to live in.
    *   He promises to provide her with water in a golden bowl.
    *   He tempts her with all his wealth, promising to cover her in gold and pearls.
*   **The Bird's Innocence:** The bird, being naive and innocent, does not understand what a cage is or the value of gold. She politely refuses his offers, explaining that she must return to her mother. She talks about her simple life – basking in the sun, playing with flowers and water, and how her mother waits for her with food. Her happiness lies in her freedom and her family.
*   **Madhavdas's Desperation:** As the bird repeatedly insists on leaving, Madhavdas becomes more desperate. He cannot understand why she would refuse such a luxurious life. He tries to trick her into staying by telling her how beautiful the garden is and how comfortable she will be.
*   **The Attempt to Capture:** While distracting the bird with conversation, Madhavdas secretly signals his servant to catch her. The servant stealthily approaches to trap the unsuspecting bird.
*   **The Escape:** Just as the servant is about to catch her, the bird feels the hard touch of his hand. Terrified, she lets out a sharp cry and flies away with all her might. She doesn't stop until she reaches her nest.
*   **Return to Safety:** The bird flies straight to her mother's embrace. Trembling with fear, she clings to her mother and falls asleep in the safety and warmth of her feathers. The experience leaves her so shaken that she doesn't open her eyes for a long time, finding ultimate solace only with her mother.

## Themes and Moral

*   **Freedom is Priceless:** The story's central theme is the immense value of freedom. The bird chooses her freedom to fly in the open sky over a life of luxury in a golden cage. It teaches us that freedom is a natural right and more valuable than any material comfort.
*   **Materialism vs. True Happiness:** Madhavdas represents a materialistic world where wealth is seen as the solution to everything. The bird, on the other hand, represents natural happiness, which comes from love, family, and nature. The story shows that money cannot buy true joy or companionship.
*   **The Power of a Mother's Love:** The bird's constant longing to return to her mother highlights the unconditional and secure bond of motherly love. For the little bird, her mother's nest is the safest and happiest place in the world.
