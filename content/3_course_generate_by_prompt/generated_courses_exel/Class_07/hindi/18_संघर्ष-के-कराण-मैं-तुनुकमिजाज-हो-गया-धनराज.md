-   **Humble Beginnings:** Dhanraj grew up in extreme poverty in Khadki, Pune. His father was a groundsman, and the family of five lived in a small house.
-   **Lack of Resources:** He could not afford his own hockey stick and kit. He used to practice with broken sticks that his friends discarded, which he would tape together.

-   **First Break:** He was first selected for the junior national team in 1985 to play in Manipur. He was only 16 years old.
-   **Feeling of Inadequacy:** When he first joined the camp, he felt out of place. He describes himself as a skinny, simple boy who spoke broken English, which made him feel insecure among the other players.

-   **The Price of Fame:** Later, in 1999, he received a Ford Ikon as a gift. However, he humorously recalls that at the time, his fame was such that he was getting expensive gifts, but his financial status (`हैसियत`) was not enough to even maintain such a car.

### 4. His "Short-Tempered" Nature

-   **Rooted in Struggle:** Dhanraj directly links his irritable nature to the hardships he endured. He felt a constant sense of frustration and anger due to his poverty and the struggles he had to face to get what he deserved.
