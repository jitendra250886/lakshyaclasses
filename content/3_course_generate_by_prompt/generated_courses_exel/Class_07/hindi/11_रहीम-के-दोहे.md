### दोहा 1: True Friendship

> कहि रहीम संपति सगे, बनत बहुत बहु रीत।
> बिपति कसौटी जे कसे, तेई साँचे मीत॥

**Word Meanings:**
*   **संपति (Sampati):** Wealth, property
*   **सगे (Sage):** Relatives, kinsmen
*   **बनत (Banat):** Become
*   **बहु रीत (Bahu reet):** In many ways
*   **बिपति (Bipati):** Adversity, trouble
*   **कसौटी (Kasauti):** Touchstone, a test
*   **कसे (Kase):** To be tested upon
*   **तेई (Tei):** Only they
*   **साँचे मीत (Saanche meet):** True friends

**Explanation:**
Rahim says that when a person is wealthy and prosperous, many people try to become their friends and relatives in various ways. However, the real test of a relationship is during times of hardship. A true friend is one who stands by you and supports you during your difficult times. Adversity is the touchstone that reveals who your true friends are.

### दोहा 2: True Love

> जाल परे जल जात बहि, तजि मीनन को मोह।
> रहिमन मछरी नीर को, तऊ न छाँड़ति छोह॥

**Word Meanings:**
*   **जाल (Jaal):** Net
*   **जल (Jal):** Water
*   **जात बहि (Jaat bahi):** Flows away
*   **तजि (Taji):** Leaving, abandoning

*   **मोह (Moh):** Attachment, affection
*   **मछरी (Machhri):** Fish
*   **नीर (Neer):** Water
*   **तऊ (Tau):** Even then, still
*   **छाँड़ति छोह (Chhadti chhoh):** Leaves love/affection

**Explanation:**
In this couplet, Rahim explains the nature of true, selfless love. When a fisherman casts a net, the water flows out of it, abandoning the fish without any attachment. However, the fish cannot bear the separation from the water and dies. This shows the fish's immense and one-sided love for the water. The water doesn't reciprocate, but the fish's love is so profound that it cannot live without it.

### दोहा 3: The Virtue of Charity

> तरुवर फल नहिं खात है, सरवर पियत न पान।
> कहि रहीम परकाज हित, संपति सँचहिं सुजान॥

**Word Meanings:**
*   **तरुवर (Taruvar):** A great tree
*   **फल (Phal):** Fruit

*   **संपति (Sampati):** Wealth
*   **सँचहिं (Sanchahin):** Accumulate, save
*   **सुजान (Sujan):** A noble or wise person

**Explanation:**
Rahim emphasizes the importance of altruism and using one's resources for the good of others. He gives two examples from nature: a tree never eats its own fruit, and a lake never drinks its own water. They exist for the benefit of others. Similarly, wise and noble people accumulate wealth not for their own selfish needs, but to help others and for the welfare of society.

### दोहा 4: Empty Boasting

> थोथे बादर क्वार के, ज्यों रहीम घहरात।
> धनी पुरुष निर्धन भये, करें पाछिली बात॥

**Word Meanings:**
*   **थोथे (Thothe):** Empty, hollow

*   **निर्धन (Nirdhan):** Poor
*   **भये (Bhaye):** Became
*   **पाछिली बात (Paachhili baat):** Talk of the past

**Explanation:**
Rahim draws a parallel between empty clouds and people who have lost their wealth. The clouds in the month of 'Kwar' (post-monsoon) thunder loudly but are empty of water and do not bring rain. In the same way, a person who was once rich but is now poor often boasts about their glorious past. Their words are like the empty thunder of those clouds—loud but meaningless and without substance in the present.

### दोहा 5: The Power of Endurance

> धरती की सी रीत है, सीत घाम औ मेह।

*   **त्यों (Tyon):** In the same way
*   **देह (Deh):** Body

**Explanation:**
Rahim teaches us the importance of tolerance and resilience. He says that we should learn from the Earth. The Earth endures all seasons—extreme cold, scorching heat, and heavy rain—with patience. Similarly, our human body should also learn to endure the ups and downs of life, whether they are moments of joy (sunshine) or sorrow (cold and rain), with equanimity and strength.

## Summary

In these couplets, the poet Rahim imparts timeless wisdom about life. He teaches us that:
*   A true friend is one who supports us in our difficult times.
*   True love is selfless and profound, as shown by the fish's love for water.
*   Noble people, like trees and lakes, use their resources for the welfare of others.
*   Boasting about past glory when one has nothing in the present is empty and meaningless.
*   We should learn to endure life's joys and sorrows with the same patience and resilience as the Earth endures different seasons.
