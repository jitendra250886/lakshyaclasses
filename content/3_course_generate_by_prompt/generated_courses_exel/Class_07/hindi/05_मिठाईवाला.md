## Plot Summary

The story unfolds in three parts, marked by the seller's visits.

### Part 1: The Toy Seller (खिलौनेवाला)

A man arrives in the locality, singing in a sweet, melodious voice, "बच्चों को बहलानेवाला, खिलौनेवाला" (The one who entertains children, the toy seller). All the children, including Chunnu and Munnu, are drawn to him. He sells beautiful toys at very low prices—just two paise each. Rohini, watching from her home, is surprised by his low prices and his affectionate way with the children. She wonders why he does this.

### Part 2: The Flute Seller (मुरलीवाला)

Six months later, the same man returns, this time selling flutes (मुरली). He sings, "बच्चों को बहलानेवाला, मुरलियावाला" (The one who entertains children, the flute seller). Rohini immediately recognizes his voice. He sells the flutes for only two paise each, even admitting that this is his cost price. He patiently teaches the children how to play them. Rohini's curiosity deepens, and she discusses the man with her husband, Vijay Babu, who thinks the seller is just a clever salesman.

### Part 3: The Sweet Seller (मिठाईवाला) and The Revelation

Eight months pass, and the man appears again, this time as a sweet seller (मिठाईवाला). His familiar, sweet voice fills the street. This time, Rohini is determined to learn his story. She asks her mother-in-law (Dadi) to call him over.

From behind a curtain (*chik*), Rohini questions him. She asks why he sells things so cheaply and why he comes to their neighborhood. Moved by her persistent and kind questioning, the seller's eyes fill with tears, and he shares his tragic past.

He reveals that he was once a wealthy man in the same town, with a beautiful wife and two lovely children. He had everything—wealth, property, and a happy family. However, a tragedy took his wife and children away from him. Now, he has nothing. To find some solace and to see a reflection of his own children in others, he sells things that children love. The happiness on their faces gives him a sense of peace and makes him feel that his children might have been reborn somewhere among them. He doesn't do it for money but for the immense satisfaction and love he receives.

After telling his story, he gives sweets to Chunnu and Munnu but refuses to take money for them. He simply says, "I have received the price already," and walks away, his voice filled with emotion. Rohini and Dadi are left speechless, with tears in their eyes, finally understanding the profound sorrow behind the sweet seller's gentle nature.

## Key Themes

*   **Parental Love (वात्सल्य):** The story is a powerful portrayal of a father's unending love for his lost children, which he expresses by loving all children.
*   **Grief and Coping Mechanism:** It shows how the seller channels his immense personal loss into an act of kindness, finding a way to live with his sorrow by spreading joy.
*   **Empathy and Human Connection:** The story emphasizes the importance of looking beyond appearances. Rohini's empathy allows her to understand the deep pain hidden behind the seller's cheerful exterior.
*   **Selfless Service:** The seller's actions are not for profit but for emotional and spiritual fulfillment, highlighting the theme of selflessness.
