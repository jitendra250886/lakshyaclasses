# Chapter 3: हिमालय की बेटियाँ (Himalaya ki Betiyan)

## Introduction

"Himalaya ki Betiyan" is a beautiful essay written by the renowned author Nagarjun. In this chapter, he presents a unique and affectionate perspective on the rivers originating from the Himalayas. Instead of seeing them merely as bodies of water, he personifies them as the playful and lively daughters of the great Himalaya mountain. The author beautifully describes their journey from the mountains to the plains, capturing their changing forms and moods.

## Detailed Explanation

### The Author's Two Perspectives of the Rivers

The chapter begins with the author describing his two different views of the rivers.

1.  **On the Plains:** When the author saw rivers like the Ganga, Yamuna, and Sutlej on the plains, they appeared calm, serious, and majestic, like a respectable and civilized woman (`संभ्रांत महिला`). Their flow was steady and vast.
2.  **In the Himalayas:** The author's perception completely changed when he saw these same rivers in their place of origin, the Himalayas. Here, they were thin, energetic, and full of life. They jumped, laughed, and playfully made their way through the mountains. This form reminded him of a young, mischievous girl (`नटखट कन्या`).

### Personification: The Himalayan Family

Nagarjun uses the literary device of personification to bring the landscape to life. He imagines a family relationship between the mountains, rivers, and the ocean.

*   **Himalayas as the Father:** The Himalayas are portrayed as a proud and loving father, from whose "lap" these river-daughters play and flow.
*   **Rivers as the Daughters:** The rivers are the energetic and restless daughters of the Himalayas. Their journey from the mountains is depicted as young girls leaving their father's home to meet their destination.
*   **The Ocean as the Son-in-law:** The author calls the ocean (`समुद्र`) the fortunate son-in-law of the Himalayas, as it gets to hold the hands of these river-daughters when they finally merge into it.

### The Journey of the Rivers

The author describes the rivers' journey with vivid imagery:
*   In the mountains, they are seen leaping over rocks, flowing through dense forests of deodar, pine, and oak. It seems as if they are playing childhood games (`बाल-लीला`).
*   Their goal is to reach the vast plains, and they are restless and eager to get there.
*   When they reach the plains, their playful, childish nature transforms into a calm and mature form, just like a girl who becomes more serene and responsible after leaving her childhood home.

### Different Relationships with the Rivers

The author doesn't just see the rivers as daughters. He explores other human relationships to describe his connection with them.

*   **Mother:** For centuries, we have revered rivers as mothers (`लोकमाता`), as they nurture life around them.
*   **Beloved (`प्रेयसी`):** Poets have often depicted rivers as a beloved. The author mentions Kalidasa's famous work *Meghdoot*, where the Vetravati (Betwa) river is described as a beloved waiting for her lover (the cloud).
*   **Sister (`बहन`):** The author establishes a personal connection with the Sutlej river. While in Tibet, feeling weary, he sits on the riverbank and dips his feet into the cold water. The refreshing feeling revitalizes him, and he feels a deep affection for the river, like that for a sister. He even composes a short poem dedicated to his "sister" Sutlej.
