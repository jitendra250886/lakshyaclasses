## Role in the 1857 Rebellion

The year 1857 marked a massive uprising against British rule across India. While the British were trying to suppress the rebellion, Veer Kunwar Singh, at the age of 80, took up the sword to free his country.

### Key Events and Battles

1.  **Leading the Rebellion:** On July 25, 1857, when the soldiers in Danapur revolted, they marched to Arrah and declared Kunwar Singh their leader. He immediately took charge and captured the Arrah fort.
2.  **Guerrilla Warfare:** Kunwar Singh was a master of guerrilla warfare (`छापामार युद्ध`). He knew that his small army couldn't defeat the large, well-equipped British army in a direct confrontation. He used surprise attacks and clever tactics to trouble the British forces.
3.  **Victories and Movements:**
    *   After the fall of Arrah, he moved to other parts of the country to organize and strengthen the rebellion.
    *   He collaborated with other leaders like Nana Saheb and Tatya Tope in Rewa, Kalpi, Kanpur, and Lucknow.
    *   His campaign was so successful that it instilled fear in the British. They were constantly defeated by his small but determined army.
4.  **Victory at Azamgarh:** In March 1858, he defeated the British forces and captured Azamgarh. This was a significant victory that boosted the morale of the freedom fighters.

### The Famous Ganga Incident

While returning to Jagdishpur, Kunwar Singh had to cross the Ganga river. The British army, led by General Douglas, was pursuing him.
*   He cleverly spread a rumor that he would cross the river at Baliya, but instead, he crossed from Shivrajpur, about 7-8 miles away.
*   As he was crossing, a bullet from a British soldier hit his arm.
*   Fearing that the poison from the bullet would spread throughout his body, he made a courageous and selfless decision. He cut off his injured arm with his sword and offered it to the sacred river Ganga, saying, "O Mother Ganga! Accept this humble offering from your son."

### Final Victory and Death

*   Despite his severe injury and old age, he reached his home in Jagdishpur and defeated the British forces there on April 23, 1858.
*   He hoisted the flag of victory at the Jagdishpur fort.
*   However, the brave warrior could not live long to enjoy this freedom. He passed away just three days later, on **April 26, 1858**, leaving behind a legacy of unparalleled bravery and patriotism.
