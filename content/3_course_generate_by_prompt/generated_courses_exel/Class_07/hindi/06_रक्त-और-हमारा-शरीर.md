# Notes for Class 7 Hindi - Chapter 6: रक्त और हमारा शरीर (Blood and Our Body)

## Introduction

This chapter, "रक्त और हमारा शरीर" (Blood and Our Body), is written by Dr. Yatish Aggarwal. It is presented as an informative conversation between two siblings, Anil and Divya, and a doctor, referred to as Dr. Didi. Through their discussion, the chapter explains the composition of blood, its functions, the causes of diseases like anemia, and the importance of blood donation in a simple and engaging way.

## Divya's Visit to the Doctor

Anil takes his younger sister, Divya, to the hospital because she has been feeling weak and tired for a few days. She has also lost her appetite. The doctor examines her and suspects she might have anemia (a deficiency of blood). She recommends a blood test to confirm.

## A Look Inside the Blood

Anil goes to the pathology lab where he meets a doctor he knows, Dr. Didi. She takes a drop of Divya's blood on a glass slide and examines it under a microscope. She invites Anil to look as well.

Anil is amazed to see that a tiny drop of blood contains millions of particles. These particles look like *Balu Shahi* (an Indian sweet) and are floating in a liquid. This observation leads to a detailed explanation of the components of blood.

## The Components of Blood

Dr. Didi explains that blood has two main parts:

1.  **Plasma (प्लाज्मा):** The liquid part of the blood.
2.  **Blood Cells/Corpuscles (रक्त कण):** The particles floating in the plasma.

These blood cells are of three types:

### 1. Red Blood Cells (RBCs) - लाल रक्त कण

*   **Appearance:** They are round, biconcave (pressed in the middle), and look like *Balu Shahi*.
*   **Function:** Their primary job is to transport oxygen from the lungs to every cell in the body. They are able to do this because of a protein called **Hemoglobin (हीमोग्लोबिन)**, which gives blood its red color.
*   **Lifespan:** RBCs have a lifespan of about 4 months. The body continuously produces new RBCs to replace the old ones. This production happens in the **bone marrow (अस्थि मज्जा)**.
*   **Building Blocks:** To make RBCs, the body needs protein, iron, and vitamins.

### 2. White Blood Cells (WBCs) - सफ़ेद रक्त कण

*   **Function:** These are the **"soldiers" (वीर सिपाही)** of our body. They fight against germs and diseases that enter our body, protecting us from infections. They are larger than RBCs but fewer in number.

### 3. Platelets (बिंबाणु)

*   **Function:** Their main role is in **blood clotting**. When we get a cut or an injury, platelets rush to the site and form a mesh-like clot, which stops the bleeding. If there were no platelets, blood would continue to flow out of a wound.

## Anemia (एनीमिया)

*   **What is it?** Anemia is a condition caused by a deficiency of hemoglobin or red blood cells in the body.
*   **Primary Cause:** The most common cause is **nutritional deficiency**. Not eating a balanced diet that is rich in iron, protein, and vitamins can lead to anemia.
*   **Other Causes:** Another significant cause, especially in India, is stomach worms. These worms can result from consuming contaminated food or water.
*   **Prevention:**
    *   Eat a **balanced diet**: Include green vegetables, fruits, milk, eggs, and meat.
    *   Maintain **hygiene**: Wash hands thoroughly before eating, drink clean water, and use toilets to prevent worm infections.

## Blood Donation (रक्तदान)

Anil asks if he can donate blood to someone in need. Dr. Didi explains the importance and facts about blood donation.

*   **Eligibility:** Any healthy person above the age of 18 can donate blood.
*   **Quantity:** Only about 300 milliliters of blood is taken at one time. Our body has about 5 liters of blood in total.
*   **Recovery:** The body replenishes this small amount of donated blood within a few days.
*   **Misconception:** It is a myth that donating blood causes weakness. It is a safe and noble act.
*   **"Mahadan" (महादान):** Donating blood is considered a great act of charity because it can save someone's life.

### Blood Banks (ब्लड बैंक)

*   Every major hospital has a **blood bank** where blood collected from donors is stored safely.
*   Blood from different blood groups (A, B, AB, O) is kept ready for emergencies.
*   Regular blood donation ensures that these blood banks are always stocked to help patients in need.
