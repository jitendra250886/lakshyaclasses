## Chapter Summary (पाठ का सार)

The play is set on a quiet, deserted street at night. The story unfolds as follows:

1.  **The Talking Objects:** The play begins with the non-living objects on the street—the electric pole, the tree, and the letterbox—talking to each other. The tree and the pole reminisce about a stormy night when the pole almost fell on the tree. The tree saved the pole, and since then, they have been good friends. The letterbox, who is literate and enjoys singing bhajans, joins their conversation.

2.  **The Arrival of the Kidnapper:** Their peaceful night is disturbed by the arrival of a man carrying a small, sleeping girl on his shoulder. The man is a child-lifter. He places the girl under the tree and leaves to find some food, planning to return later.

3.  **A Plan to Save the Girl:** The tree, pole, letterbox, and a crow who has been watching everything are horrified. They feel deep sympathy for the little girl and decide they must do something to save her from the kidnapper.

4.  **The Girl Wakes Up:** The little girl wakes up and finds herself in a strange place. She is scared and starts crying for her father. The letterbox, in a gentle voice, tries to comfort her. Initially, she is frightened to hear inanimate objects talking, but their kind words slowly calm her down.

5.  **The Search for an Address:** The characters try to find out the girl's address or her father's name so they can help her get home. Unfortunately, the innocent girl doesn't know her full address, the name of her street, or even her father's name, simply referring to him as "Papa."

6.  **The Final Rescue Plan:** Realizing they cannot take her home themselves, they devise a clever plan to attract the attention of passersby in the morning.
    *   The crow suggests that the tree should bend over the girl to provide shade and make the scene look unusual.
    *   The electric pole agrees to bend over as if an accident has occurred, which will surely draw the attention of the police.
    *   The letterbox suggests that he will slowly slide down and say, "If anyone finds the father of this sweet girl, please bring him here."
    *   The crow will caw loudly to scare the kidnapper if he returns.

The play ends on a hopeful note. As morning approaches, all the characters take their positions. The tree and the pole are bent over the sleeping girl, and the letterbox is ready with his message. They all wait, hoping that someone will notice their strange setup and help the little girl find her "lost papa." The title "पापा खो गए" (Papa is lost) is a clever twist, reflecting the girl's perspective.

## Question and Answers (प्रश्न-अभ्यास)

**Q1: नाटक में आपको सबसे बुद्धिमान पात्र कौन लगा और क्यों? (Who did you find to be the most intelligent character in the play and why?)**

**A:** In the play, the letterbox, or "लाल ताऊ," seemed to be the most intelligent character. He was the only one who could read and write, which made him knowledgeable. He was calm, empathetic, and guided the others. It was his idea to create a scene that would attract attention and his suggestion to write a message for the girl's father that formed the core of the final rescue plan.

**Q2: पेड़ और खंभे में दोस्ती कैसे हुई? (How did the tree and the pole become friends?)**

**A:** Initially, the pole was very arrogant and did not talk to the tree. One day, a fierce storm caused the pole to bend and fall onto the tree. The tree supported the pole and saved it from breaking completely. This incident broke the pole's pride, and he became grateful to the tree. From that day on, they became good friends.

**Q3: लाल ताऊ किस प्रकार बाकी पात्रों से भिन्न है? (How is Lal Tau different from the other characters?)**

**A:** Lal Tau (the letterbox) is different from other characters in several ways:
*   He is the only character who can read and write.
*   He is painted bright red, making him stand out.
*   He is more worldly-wise as he reads the letters people post in him.
*   He is a mature and fatherly figure who leads the group and comforts the scared child.
*   He can also sing bhajans, which shows his reflective nature.

**Q4: क्या वजह थी कि सभी पात्र मिलकर भी लड़की को उसके घर नहीं पहुँचा पा रहे थे? (What was the reason that all the characters together could not get the girl to her home?)**

**A:** The main reason the characters could not take the girl home was that the girl was too young and innocent to know her complete address. She did not know the name of her street, her house number, or even her father's name. Without this crucial information, the stationary characters like the tree, pole, and letterbox were helpless and could not guide her home.
