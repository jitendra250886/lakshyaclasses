# Chapter 4: Heat

## 1. Hot and Cold

In our daily lives, we encounter many objects. Some are hot, like a cup of tea, while others are cold, like ice cream. We often use our sense of touch to determine if an object is hot or cold. However, our sense of touch can be misleading and is not a reliable way to measure the degree of hotness.

**Heat** is a form of energy that flows from a hotter object to a colder object.

**Temperature** is the reliable measure of the degree of hotness or coldness of an object. The device used to measure temperature is called a **thermometer**.

## 2. Measuring Temperature

### Thermometers
A thermometer is a device used for measuring temperature. The most common thermometers, like clinical and laboratory thermometers, consist of a long, narrow glass tube with a bulb at one end containing a liquid (usually mercury or alcohol). As the temperature rises, the liquid expands and moves up the tube.

#### a) Clinical Thermometer
A clinical thermometer is used to measure human body temperature.

*   **Range:** It measures temperature from **35°C to 42°C**.
*   **Features:** It has a small bend or **kink** in the tube just above the bulb. This kink prevents the mercury level from falling down on its own, allowing us to read the temperature accurately after taking it out of the mouth.
*   **Normal Body Temperature:** The normal temperature of the human body is **37°C**.
*   **Precautions for Use:**
    1.  Wash the thermometer before and after use, preferably with an antiseptic solution.
    2.  Ensure the mercury level is below 35°C before use.
    3.  Hold the thermometer firmly and give it a few jerks to bring the mercury level down.
    4.  Read the thermometer by keeping the level of mercury along the line of sight.
    5.  Handle it with care as it can break. Do not hold it by the bulb.

#### b) Laboratory Thermometer
A laboratory thermometer is used in science labs to measure the temperature of objects other than the human body.

*   **Range:** The range is generally from **-10°C to 110°C**.
*   **Features:** It does not have a kink.
*   **Precautions for Use:**
    1.  It should be kept upright, not tilted.
    2.  The bulb should be surrounded from all sides by the substance whose temperature is to be measured.
    3.  The bulb should not touch the surface of the container.

| Feature | Clinical Thermometer | Laboratory Thermometer |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Purpose** | To measure human body temperature. | To measure temperature in a lab. |
| **Range** | 35°C to 42°C | -10°C to 110°C (Typical) |
| **Kink** | Present | Absent |
| **Reading** | Can be read after removing from the source. | Must be read while in contact with the source. |

#### c) Digital Thermometers
These are modern thermometers that do not use mercury. They are safer, easier to read (as they display the temperature on an LCD screen), and are widely used now.

## 3. Transfer of Heat

Heat always flows from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature. This movement of heat is called **heat transfer**. There are three ways in which heat can be transferred:

1.  Conduction
2.  Convection
3.  Radiation

### a) Conduction
Conduction is the process by which heat is transferred from the hotter end to the colder end of an object, usually in **solids**. The particles of the object do not move from their position; they just pass on the heat energy to their neighboring particles.

*   **Conductors:** Materials that allow heat to pass through them easily are called conductors of heat.
    *   **Examples:** Metals like iron, aluminum, copper, and silver.
*   **Insulators (or Poor Conductors):** Materials that do not allow heat to pass through them easily are called insulators.
    *   **Examples:** Wood, plastic, glass, rubber, and air.

### b) Convection
Convection is the mode of heat transfer that takes place in **liquids and gases (fluids)**. In this process, the particles of the substance actually move from one place to another, carrying heat with them.

*   When a fluid is heated, the particles near the heat source get hot, become lighter, and rise up.
*   The cooler, denser particles from the surroundings move in to take their place.
*   This process continues, creating a flow called a **convection current**.

**Examples in Nature:**

*   **Sea Breeze:** During the day, the land heats up faster than the sea. The hot air above the land rises, and the cooler air from the sea moves towards the land to take its place. This is called the sea breeze.
*   **Land Breeze:** At night, the land cools down faster than the sea. The warm air above the sea rises, and the cooler air from the land moves towards the sea. This is called the land breeze.

### c) Radiation
Radiation is the mode of heat transfer that does not require any medium. Heat can be transferred through a vacuum (empty space) by radiation.

*   **Example:** The heat from the Sun reaches the Earth through radiation.
*   All hot bodies radiate heat. When this heat falls on an object, a part of it is reflected, a part is absorbed, and a part may be transmitted.
*   The temperature of the object increases due to the absorbed part of the heat.

| Mode of Transfer | Medium Required | How it Works | Primary State |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conduction** | Yes | Transfer through direct particle contact. | Solids |
| **Convection** | Yes | Transfer through the movement of particles. | Liquids & Gases |
| **Radiation** | No | Transfer through electromagnetic waves. | Any (works in vacuum) |

## 4. Kinds of Clothes We Wear in Summer and Winter

The color of our clothes plays a significant role in how comfortable we feel during different seasons. This is directly related to the principle of heat radiation.

*   **Summer:** We prefer to wear **light-colored clothes** in summer. Light colors are poor absorbers and good reflectors of heat. They reflect most of the sunlight that falls on them, keeping our bodies cool. Cotton clothes are also preferred as they allow air to circulate and absorb sweat.

*   **Winter:** We prefer to wear **dark-colored clothes** in winter. Dark colors are good absorbers of heat. They absorb the heat from the sun and keep our bodies warm. We also wear **woolen clothes**. Wool is a poor conductor of heat, and the air trapped between the wool fibers acts as an insulator, preventing our body heat from escaping into the cold surroundings.

## Summary

*   **Heat** is a form of energy that flows from a hot body to a cold body.
*   **Temperature** is the measure of the degree of hotness or coldness. It is measured using a **thermometer**.
*   A **clinical thermometer** is used to measure body temperature (range 35°C to 42°C), while a **laboratory thermometer** is used for other scientific purposes.
*   Heat is transferred in three ways: **conduction** (in solids), **convection** (in liquids and gases), and **radiation** (no medium required).
*   Materials that conduct heat well are **conductors** (e.g., metals), while those that don't are **insulators** (e.g., wood, plastic).
*   In summer, we wear light-colored clothes because they reflect heat. In winter, we wear dark-colored and woolen clothes because they absorb and trap heat, respectively.
