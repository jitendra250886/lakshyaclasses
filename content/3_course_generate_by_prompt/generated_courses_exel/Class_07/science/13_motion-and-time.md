# Chapter 13: Motion and Time

## 1. Introduction to Motion

Motion is a fundamental concept in physics. An object is said to be in **motion** if it changes its position with respect to time. If an object's position does not change with time, it is said to be at **rest**.

-   **Examples of Motion:** A moving car, a flying bird, the hands of a clock.
-   **Examples of Rest:** A house, a tree, a book on a table.

Motion is relative. For example, a person sitting in a moving bus is at rest with respect to other passengers but is in motion with respect to a person standing on the road.

## 2. Types of Motion

Objects can move in different ways. Some common types of motion are:

-   **Rectilinear Motion:** Motion along a straight line.
    -   *Example:* A car moving on a straight road, a sprinter running on a 100m track.
-   **Circular Motion:** Motion along a circular path.
    -   *Example:* The tip of the hands of a clock, a stone tied to a string and whirled around.
-   **Periodic Motion:** Motion that repeats itself after a fixed interval of time.
    -   *Example:* The swinging of a pendulum, a child on a swing, the revolution of the Earth around the Sun.

## 3. Slow and Fast Motion

We often describe motion as slow or fast. This is determined by the object's **speed**.

-   An object is considered **fast** if it covers more distance in a given amount of time compared to another object.
-   An object is considered **slow** if it takes more time to cover the same distance compared to another object.

The most reliable way to compare the motion of objects is to calculate their speed.

## 4. Speed

**Speed** is defined as the distance covered by an object in a unit of time.

### Formula for Speed
The formula to calculate speed is:
**Speed = Total Distance Covered / Total Time Taken**

For example, if a car covers a distance of 100 km in 2 hours, its speed is:
Speed = 100 km / 2 h = 50 km/h

### Uniform and Non-Uniform Motion

-   **Uniform Motion:** When an object moves along a straight line with a **constant speed**, its motion is called uniform motion.
-   **Non-Uniform Motion:** When the speed of an object moving along a straight line **keeps changing**, its motion is called non-uniform motion. In this case, we often calculate the **average speed**.

## 5. Measurement of Time

The measurement of time is crucial for studying motion.

### Ancient Time-Measuring Devices
In ancient times, people used natural events and simple devices to measure time:
-   **Sundials:** Used the position of the shadow cast by the sun.
-   **Water Clocks and Sand Clocks:** Worked on the principle of a regulated flow of water or sand.

### The Simple Pendulum
A simple pendulum is a classic example of periodic motion and was used in early clocks.
-   **Components:** It consists of a small metallic ball (called a **bob**) suspended from a rigid stand by a thread.
-   **Oscillation:** One complete to-and-fro movement of the pendulum is called one oscillation.
-   **Time Period:** The time taken by the pendulum to complete one oscillation is called its time period. The time period of a given pendulum is constant.

Modern clocks and watches, like **quartz clocks**, use the vibrations of quartz crystals to measure time much more accurately.

## 6. Units of Time and Speed

Standard units are used for consistent measurement.

| Quantity | Basic Unit | Other Common Units |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Time** | second (s) | minute (min), hour (h) |
| **Speed** | metre per second (m/s) | kilometre per hour (km/h) |

**Conversions:**
-   60 seconds = 1 minute
-   60 minutes = 1 hour
-   24 hours = 1 day

### Measuring Speed in Vehicles
Vehicles are equipped with instruments to measure speed and distance:
-   **Speedometer:** An instrument that shows the speed of the vehicle in km/h.
-   **Odometer:** An instrument that measures the total distance covered by the vehicle.

## 7. Distance-Time Graphs

A distance-time graph is a line graph that shows how the distance covered by an object changes with time. It is a convenient way to represent the motion of an object.

### How to Plot a Distance-Time Graph
1.  Draw two perpendicular lines to represent the axes (X-axis and Y-axis).
2.  Mark the **time** along the X-axis (horizontal) and the **distance** along the Y-axis (vertical).
3.  Choose a suitable scale for both axes (e.g., 1 cm = 1 minute on the X-axis, 1 cm = 1 km on the Y-axis).
4.  Plot the points on the graph corresponding to the distance and time values.
5.  Join the points to get the line graph.

### Interpreting a Distance-Time Graph

-   **Object at Rest:** The graph is a straight line parallel to the time axis (X-axis). This shows that the distance is not changing with time.
    

-   **Object in Uniform Motion (Constant Speed):** The graph is a straight line with a slope. The steeper the slope, the higher the speed.
    

-   **Object in Non-Uniform Motion:** The graph is a curved line.
    

## Summary

-   **Motion** is the change in an object's position over time.
-   Motion can be rectilinear (straight line), circular, or periodic (repeating).
-   **Speed** is the distance covered per unit of time (Speed = Distance / Time).
-   Motion with constant speed is **uniform motion**, while motion with changing speed is **non-uniform motion**.
-   Time is measured using clocks, which are often based on periodic events. The basic unit of time is the **second (s)**.
-   The basic unit of speed is **metres per second (m/s)**.
-   **Distance-time graphs** are used to visually represent an object's motion. A straight line parallel to the time axis indicates an object at rest, while a sloped straight line indicates uniform motion.
