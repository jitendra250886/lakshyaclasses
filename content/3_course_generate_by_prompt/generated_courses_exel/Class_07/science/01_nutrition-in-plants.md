# Nutrition in Plants

## Introduction to Nutrition

All living organisms, from the smallest bacteria to the largest whale, require energy to perform life processes like growth, repair, and movement. This energy comes from food. The process of taking in food and using it for growth and maintenance is called **nutrition**.

The components of food that provide this energy and are necessary for our body are called **nutrients**. The major nutrients are:
*   Carbohydrates
*   Proteins
*   Fats
*   Vitamins
*   Minerals

## Modes of Nutrition

Organisms obtain their food in different ways. Based on their mode of nutrition, they can be broadly classified into two categories:

| Mode of Nutrition | Description | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Autotrophic** | Organisms that make their own food from simple substances. (Auto = self; trophos = nourishment) | Green Plants, Algae |
| **Heterotrophic** | Organisms that depend on other organisms (plants or animals) for their food. (Heteros = other) | Animals, Humans, Fungi |

### 1. Autotrophic Nutrition in Plants

Green plants are called **autotrophs** because they produce their own food. They do this through a process called **photosynthesis**.

#### Photosynthesis: The Food-Making Process

Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create their own food in the form of glucose (a carbohydrate) and release oxygen as a byproduct.

*   **Photo** means 'light' and **synthesis** means 'to combine'.
*   **Location:** Photosynthesis primarily occurs in the leaves, which are known as the 'food factories' of the plant.

**Requirements for Photosynthesis:**

1.  **Sunlight:** The ultimate source of energy, captured by chlorophyll.
2.  **Chlorophyll:** A green pigment found in the chloroplasts of plant cells. It is responsible for trapping sunlight.
3.  **Carbon Dioxide (COâ‚‚):** Taken from the atmosphere through tiny pores on the surface of the leaves called **stomata**. These pores are surrounded by **guard cells** that control their opening and closing.
4.  **Water & Minerals:** Absorbed from the soil by the roots and transported to the leaves through pipe-like vessels.

**The Process of Photosynthesis:**

The overall process can be represented by the following equation:

`Carbon Dioxide + Water --(in the presence of Sunlight & Chlorophyll)--> Carbohydrate (Glucose) + Oxygen`



The food produced (glucose) is a carbohydrate, which is later converted into starch and stored in different parts of the plant like leaves, stems, roots, and fruits. The oxygen released during this process is essential for the survival of all living organisms.

### 2. Heterotrophic Nutrition in Plants

Not all plants are green and can perform photosynthesis. Some plants lack chlorophyll and depend on other organisms for their food. This is called heterotrophic nutrition.

#### i. Parasitic Plants

A **parasite** is an organism that lives on or inside another organism (the **host**) and derives its nutrition from it, often harming the host.

*   **Example:** **Cuscuta (Amarbel)** is a yellow, wire-like plant that lacks chlorophyll. It coils around the host plant and uses special structures to absorb ready-made food from the host's vascular tissues.

#### ii. Insectivorous Plants

These are plants that trap and digest insects to fulfill their nutritional requirements, particularly for nitrogen. They typically grow in soil that is deficient in nitrogen.

*   **Example 1: Pitcher Plant:** The leaf is modified into a pitcher-like structure. The apex of the leaf forms a lid. Inside the pitcher, there are downward-pointing hairs. When an insect enters, the lid closes, and the insect gets trapped and is digested by juices secreted inside the pitcher.
*   **Example 2: Venus Flytrap:** Has jaw-like leaves that snap shut when an insect touches its trigger hairs.

#### iii. Saprotrophic Plants

**Saprotrophs** are organisms that get their nutrition from dead and decaying organic matter. This mode of nutrition is called **saprotrophic nutrition**.

*   They secrete digestive juices onto the matter, which convert it into a solution. They then absorb the nutrients from this solution.
*   **Example:** **Fungi** like mushrooms, bread mould, and yeast. You can often see them growing on stale bread, rotting wood, or pickles during the rainy season.

#### iv. Symbiotic Relationship

Sometimes, two different organisms live together and share shelter and nutrients for their mutual benefit. This is called a **symbiotic relationship**.

*   **Example 1: Lichens:** A lichen is a composite organism formed from a fungus and an alga living together.
    *   The **fungus** provides shelter, water, and minerals.
    *   The **alga**, being green, prepares food by photosynthesis and shares it with the fungus.
*   **Example 2: Rhizobium Bacteria:** These bacteria live in the root nodules of leguminous plants (like peas, beans, and gram).
    *   The **plant** provides food and shelter to the bacteria.
    *   The **Rhizobium bacteria** convert atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form (like nitrates) for the plant, enriching the soil.

## How Nutrients are Replenished in the Soil

Plants continuously absorb mineral nutrients from the soil. Over time, this depletes the concentration of these nutrients in the soil, making it less fertile. Therefore, it is essential to replenish them.

**Methods of Replenishment:**

1.  **Adding Manures and Fertilisers:** Farmers add manures (organic) and fertilisers (chemical) to the soil. These contain essential plant nutrients like **Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K)**.
2.  **Nitrogen Fixation:** The symbiotic relationship between Rhizobium bacteria and leguminous plants is a natural way to enrich the soil with nitrogen. Growing leguminous crops helps restore the soil's nitrogen content naturally.

## Summary

*   Nutrition is the process of taking in food and utilizing it for energy, growth, and repair.
*   Plants exhibit two main modes of nutrition: **autotrophic** (making their own food) and **heterotrophic** (depending on others for food).
*   **Photosynthesis** is the process used by green plants to make food, requiring sunlight, chlorophyll, carbon dioxide, and water. The products are carbohydrates and oxygen.
*   Heterotrophic plants include **parasites** (Cuscuta), **insectivores** (Pitcher Plant), and **saprotrophs** (Fungi).
*   A **symbiotic relationship** is a mutually beneficial partnership between two organisms, such as in lichens and Rhizobium bacteria in root nodules.
*   Nutrients in the soil are replenished by adding fertilisers and manures or through natural processes like nitrogen fixation by bacteria.
