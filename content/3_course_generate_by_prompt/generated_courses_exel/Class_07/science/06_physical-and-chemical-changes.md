# Chapter 6: Physical And Chemical Changes

## Introduction to Changes

Every day, we observe many changes around us. For example, your mother may ask you to dissolve sugar in water to make a cold drink. Making a sugar solution is a change. Similarly, setting curd from milk is a change. Some changes are temporary and can be reversed, while others are permanent. These changes can be broadly classified into two types: physical changes and chemical changes.

## 1. Physical Changes

A change in which only the **physical properties** of a substance change, and **no new substance is formed**, is called a physical change.

### Characteristics of Physical Changes
*   **No New Substance:** The most important characteristic is that the chemical composition of the substance remains the same. For example, water exists as ice (solid), water (liquid), or steam (gas), but it is always H₂O.
*   **Reversible:** Most physical changes are reversible. This means the original substance can be recovered easily. For example, you can get ice back from water by freezing it.
*   **Temporary Change:** The change is temporary and lasts only as long as the conditions causing the change are present.
*   **Change in Physical Properties:** There might be a change in properties like state (solid, liquid, gas), shape, size, or colour.

### Examples of Physical Changes
1.  **Melting of Ice:** Ice (solid water) melts to form water (liquid water). You can freeze the water back into ice. Only the state has changed.
2.  **Boiling of Water:** Water (liquid) boils to form steam (gaseous water). The steam can condense back into liquid water.
3.  **Tearing a piece of paper:** When you tear paper, its size and shape change, but it is still paper. No new substance is formed.
4.  **Dissolving Sugar in Water:** When sugar is dissolved in water, it forms a solution. The sugar is still present in the water and can be recovered by evaporating the water.
5.  **Stretching a Rubber Band:** The shape and size of the rubber band change, but it remains a rubber band.

## 2. Chemical Changes

A change in which **one or more new substances are formed** with entirely new chemical compositions and properties is called a chemical change. A chemical change is also known as a **chemical reaction**.

### Characteristics of Chemical Changes
*   **New Substance Formed:** One or more new substances with different properties are formed.
*   **Irreversible:** Most chemical changes are permanent and cannot be easily reversed by simple physical methods.
*   **Permanent Change:** The change in the chemical composition is permanent.
*   **Energy Change:** Chemical changes are often accompanied by the absorption or release of energy, usually in the form of heat, light, or sound.

### Indicators of a Chemical Change
A chemical change may be accompanied by:
*   Production of heat or light (e.g., burning a matchstick).
*   Production of a sound (e.g., bursting of a firecracker).
*   Change in colour (e.g., an apple slice turning brown).
*   Evolution of a gas (e.g., adding baking soda to vinegar).
*   Change in smell (e.g., food getting spoiled).

### Examples of Chemical Changes
1.  **Burning of Magnesium Ribbon:** When a magnesium ribbon is burnt, it reacts with oxygen from the air to form a new substance, magnesium oxide (a white powder).
    *   *Magnesium (Mg) + Oxygen (O₂) → Magnesium Oxide (MgO)*
2.  **Rusting of Iron:** Iron objects, when exposed to oxygen and moisture (water), form a reddish-brown flaky substance called rust. Rust is a new substance (hydrated iron oxide) and is different from iron.
3.  **Digestion of Food:** The food we eat is broken down into simpler substances by enzymes in our body. This is a complex chemical change.
4.  **Setting of Curd from Milk:** The bacteria *Lactobacillus* convert the lactose sugar in milk into lactic acid, which results in the formation of curd. Curd is a new substance with different properties than milk.
5.  **Reaction between Vinegar and Baking Soda:** When vinegar (acetic acid) is mixed with baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), a gas (carbon dioxide) is produced with a hissing sound.
    *   *Vinegar + Baking Soda → Carbon Dioxide + Other substances*

## Comparison between Physical and Chemical Changes

| Basis of Difference | Physical Change | Chemical Change |
| :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **New Substance** | No new substance is formed. | One or more new substances are formed. |
| **Reversibility** | Generally reversible. | Generally irreversible. |
| **Nature of Change** | It is a temporary change. | It is a permanent change. |
| **Composition** | The chemical composition of the substance does not change. | The chemical composition of the substance changes. |
| **Energy** | Very little or no energy (heat, light etc.) is absorbed or released. | A significant amount of energy is often absorbed or released. |
| **Examples** | Melting of ice, boiling of water, tearing paper. | Burning of wood, rusting of iron, digestion of food. |

## Special Topics

### 1. Rusting of Iron

Rusting is a chemical change that corrodes iron and makes it weak.
*   **Conditions for Rusting:** The presence of both **oxygen** and **water** (or water vapour) is essential for rusting to occur.
*   **Chemical Equation:**
    *   *Iron (Fe) + Oxygen (O₂) + Water (H₂O) → Rust (Hydrated Iron Oxide - Fe₂O₃·nH₂O)*
*   **Prevention of Rusting:** We can prevent iron from coming in contact with oxygen and moisture.
    *   **Painting or Greasing:** Applying a coat of paint or grease on iron surfaces.
    *   **Galvanization:** The process of depositing a layer of a metal like zinc or chromium on iron. Zinc is more reactive than iron and protects it from rusting. This is used in pipes, buckets, etc.
    *   **Alloying:** Mixing iron with other metals like carbon, chromium, and nickel to make stainless steel, which does not rust.

### 2. Crystallization

Crystallization is a process of obtaining large, pure crystals of a substance from its solution. It is an example of a **physical change**.
*   **Process:** A saturated solution of the substance is prepared (usually in hot water), and then it is allowed to cool down slowly. As it cools, the dissolved substance separates out in the form of pure crystals.
*   **Example:** Obtaining pure crystals of copper sulphate from an impure sample.

## Summary

This chapter explores the two primary types of changes substances undergo. A **physical change** alters the physical properties (like shape, size, or state) of a substance without creating a new substance and is often reversible. Examples include melting ice and tearing paper. In contrast, a **chemical change**, or chemical reaction, results in the formation of one or more entirely new substances with different properties. These changes are generally permanent and irreversible, often accompanied by energy changes. Key examples include rusting of iron, burning wood, and digestion. Understanding the difference is crucial, and special processes like rusting (a destructive chemical change) and crystallization (a physical purification technique) are important applications of these concepts.
