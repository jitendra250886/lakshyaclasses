# Chapter 14: Electric Current and Its Effects

## Introduction to Electric Current

An **electric current** is the flow of electric charge, which we commonly understand as the flow of electricity through wires. For an electric current to flow, we need a closed path, known as an **electric circuit**, and a source of electricity, like a cell or a battery.

## Symbols of Electric Components

To draw diagrams of electric circuits easily, we use standard symbols to represent different components. These diagrams are called **circuit diagrams**.

| Component | Symbol | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Electric Cell** |  | A single source of electric energy. The longer line is the positive (+) terminal and the shorter, thicker line is the negative (-) terminal. |
| **Electric Bulb** |  | A device that produces light when current flows through it. |
| **Switch (ON position)** |  | Allows the current to flow. The circuit is **closed**. |
| **Switch (OFF position)** |  | Stops the flow of current. The circuit is **open**. |
| **Battery** |  | A combination of two or more cells. The positive terminal of one cell is connected to the negative terminal of the next. |
| **Wire** |  | A straight line representing the connecting wire. |

## Electric Circuits

An electric circuit is the complete path along which an electric current can flow.

*   **Open Circuit:** When the switch is in the 'OFF' position, there is a gap in the circuit. No current flows, and the bulb does not glow.
*   **Closed Circuit:** When the switch is in the 'ON' position, the path is complete. Current flows from the positive terminal to the negative terminal of the battery, and the bulb glows.

## Effects of Electric Current

When an electric current flows through a wire, it produces two main effects:
1.  Heating Effect
2.  Magnetic Effect

### 1. Heating Effect of Electric Current

When an electric current passes through a wire, the wire gets hot. This is known as the **heating effect of electric current**.

*   **How it works:** The heat is produced due to the resistance of the wire to the flow of current.
*   **Factors:** The amount of heat produced depends on the material, length, and thickness of the wire.
*   **Applications:** This effect is used in many appliances:
    *   **Electric Heater/Iron:** They have a coil of wire called an **element**. When current flows, this element becomes red-hot and gives out heat.
    *   **Electric Bulb:** The thin wire inside a bulb, called the **filament**, gets heated to a very high temperature and starts glowing, producing light.

#### Electric Fuse: A Safety Device
An **electric fuse** is a safety device that works on the heating effect of current.
*   It consists of a wire made of a special material that melts quickly and breaks when a large electric current passes through it.
*   If too much current flows (due to a short circuit or overloading), the fuse wire melts, breaking the circuit.
*   This stops the flow of current and prevents damage to appliances and potential fires.
*   Nowadays, **Miniature Circuit Breakers (MCBs)** are increasingly used instead of fuses. They are switches that automatically turn off when the current in a circuit exceeds the safe limit. They can be reset manually.

### 2. Magnetic Effect of Electric Current

When an electric current passes through a wire, it behaves like a magnet. This is the **magnetic effect of electric current**.

*   **Discovery:** This was first observed by the scientist **Hans Christian Oersted**. He noticed that a compass needle gets deflected when an electric current flows in a nearby wire.
*   **Electromagnet:** A current-carrying coil of insulated wire wrapped around a piece of iron is called an **electromagnet**.
    *   It behaves like a magnet only as long as the current is flowing through the coil.
    *   The strength of an electromagnet can be increased by increasing the number of turns in the coil or by increasing the current.
*   **Applications:**
    *   Used in cranes to lift heavy iron objects.
    *   Used by doctors to remove tiny iron particles from the eye.
    *   Used in many toys and devices like the **electric bell**.

#### The Electric Bell
An electric bell is a common device that works on the principle of an electromagnet.

**Working:**
1.  **Circuit Closed:** When you press the switch, the electric circuit is completed.
2.  **Electromagnet Activates:** Current flows through the coil, which becomes an electromagnet.
3.  **Hammer Strikes Gong:** The electromagnet pulls an iron strip towards it. A hammer attached to this strip strikes the gong, producing a sound.
4.  **Circuit Breaks:** As the iron strip moves towards the magnet, it loses contact with the contact screw. This breaks the circuit.
5.  **Electromagnet Deactivates:** The current stops flowing, and the coil is no longer an electromagnet.
6.  **Hammer Returns:** The iron strip springs back to its original position and touches the contact screw again.
7.  **Cycle Repeats:** This completes the circuit again, and the process repeats rapidly, causing the bell to ring continuously as long as the switch is pressed.



## Summary

*   An electric current is the flow of electric charge through a closed path called an electric circuit.
*   We use standard symbols to represent components like cells, batteries, switches, and bulbs in circuit diagrams.
*   When current flows through a wire, it produces a **heating effect**. This principle is used in appliances like heaters, irons, and bulbs, and in safety devices like fuses.
*   An electric current also produces a **magnetic effect**, meaning a current-carrying wire behaves like a magnet.
*   An **electromagnet** is a temporary magnet created by passing current through a coil of wire wrapped around an iron core.
*   The magnetic effect of current is used in devices like cranes and the electric bell.
