# 18. Wastewater Story

## Introduction: Water, Our Lifeline

Water is essential for all life. We use it every day for drinking, cooking, bathing, and cleaning. When water is used, it becomes dirty. This used water, rich in lather, mixed with oil, dirt, and other wastes, is called **wastewater**. We cannot simply dump this wastewater into rivers or lakes as it would pollute them and harm aquatic life and human health. Therefore, it is crucial to clean this water before releasing it back into the environment.

**World Water Day** is celebrated on **22nd March** every year to raise awareness about the importance of conserving water.

## What is Wastewater and Sewage?

**Wastewater** is any water that has been affected by human use. This includes water from homes (sinks, showers, toilets), industries, and hospitals.

**Sewage** is a specific type of wastewater that is carried away from homes and other buildings through a system of pipes. It is a complex mixture containing suspended solids, organic and inorganic impurities, nutrients, and microbes.

### Impurities in Sewage

The impurities present in sewage are called **contaminants**. They can be categorized as follows:

| Type of Impurity | Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Organic Impurities** | Human feces, animal waste, urea, oil, fruit and vegetable waste, pesticides, herbicides. |
| **Inorganic Impurities** | Nitrates, phosphates, metals (like lead, mercury). |
| **Nutrients** | Phosphorus and Nitrogen. |
| **Microbes** | Bacteria (e.g., *Vibrio cholerae* which causes cholera, *Salmonella paratyphi* which causes typhoid) and Protozoa (e.g., which cause dysentery). |

## The Journey of Wastewater: Sewerage System

In towns and cities, a network of pipes is laid to carry wastewater from its source to a treatment plant.

*   **Sewers:** These are the underground pipes that carry sewage.
*   **Sewerage:** This is the entire network of sewers, forming a transport system for wastewater.
*   **Manholes:** These are covered openings located on the sewerage lines, typically at every 50-60 meters, at junctions, or where there is a change in direction. They are used for inspection and cleaning of the sewer lines.

The wastewater flows from homes and buildings into the sewer system, which then transports it to a **Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP)**.

## Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP)

A WWTP is a facility where wastewater is cleaned through a series of physical, biological, and chemical processes before it is discharged back into the environment.

The treatment process involves the following steps:

#### 1. Primary Treatment (Physical Process)

*   **Bar Screens:** Wastewater is first passed through large screens. These bar screens remove large objects like rags, sticks, plastic bags, cans, and napkins.
*   **Grit and Sand Removal:** The water then flows into a large tank where the speed of the water is decreased. This allows heavy particles like sand, grit, and pebbles to settle down at the bottom.

#### 2. Secondary Treatment (Biological Process)

*   **Sedimentation (Clarifier):** The water is then moved to a large tank called a clarifier, which slopes towards the center. Solid organic waste like feces settles at the bottom and is collected. This settled solid is called **sludge**. Floatable impurities like oil and grease are removed with a **skimmer**. The water that is cleared is called **clarified water**.
*   **Sludge Treatment:** The collected sludge is transferred to a separate tank called a digester. Here, **anaerobic bacteria** (bacteria that don't need oxygen) break down the organic matter in the sludge. This process produces **biogas** (a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide), which can be used as a fuel. The remaining dried sludge can be used as manure.
*   **Aeration:** Air is pumped into the clarified water in an aeration tank. This helps **aerobic bacteria** (bacteria that need oxygen) to grow rapidly. These bacteria consume the remaining organic waste, soaps, and other unwanted matter still present in the clarified water.

#### 3. Tertiary Treatment (Chemical/Final Process)

*   **Final Clarification:** The water is then moved to another clarifier where the bacterial mass settles at the bottom as **activated sludge**. About 97% of the water is now clean.
*   **Disinfection:** The treated water is disinfected to kill any remaining harmful germs before it is released. This is done by adding chemicals like **chlorine** or **ozone**, or by exposing it to **ultraviolet (UV) light**.

After this final step, the treated water is safe to be released into a river, sea, or groundwater.

## Better Housekeeping Practices: Your Role

We can reduce the load on WWTPs and prevent drains from clogging by adopting good habits at home.

*   **Do not** pour cooking oils and fats down the drain. They can harden and block the pipes. Collect them in a dustbin.
*   **Do not** throw chemicals like paints, solvents, insecticides, medicines, or motor oil into the drain. They can kill the helpful microbes that purify water.
*   **Do not** throw solid waste like tea leaves, food remains, cotton, sanitary towels, or soft toys into the drain. These can choke the drains. Always use a dustbin.

## Sanitation and Disease

**Sanitation** refers to public health conditions related to clean drinking water and adequate treatment and disposal of sewage. Poor sanitation and contaminated drinking water are the root cause of many diseases.

*   Untreated sewage contains harmful bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites.
*   Drinking water contaminated with this sewage can cause water-borne diseases like **cholera, typhoid, dysentery, hepatitis, polio, and meningitis**.
*   A large part of our population still defecates in the open, on dry riverbeds, or near railway tracks. This untreated human excreta pollutes soil and water sources, spreading diseases.

## Alternative Sewage Disposal Systems

In areas where there is no proper sewerage system, low-cost onsite sanitation systems can be adopted.

*   **Septic Tanks:** Suitable for places like hospitals, isolated buildings, or a small cluster of houses. The toilet waste flows into an underground tank where anaerobic bacteria decompose the sludge.
*   **Chemical Toilets:** These are self-contained, portable toilets that use chemicals to disinfect the waste and reduce odors. They require very little water.
*   **Vermicomposting Toilets:** A design where human waste is treated by earthworms. The earthworms turn the waste into a nutrient-rich compost called vermi-cake.
*   **Composting Pits:** A simple pit toilet where human excreta is covered with soil, ash, or sawdust to convert it into compost over time.

## Sanitation in Public Places

Maintaining sanitation is not just the government's responsibility; it is the duty of every citizen.

*   Public places like airports, railway stations, bus depots, and hospitals generate large amounts of waste.
*   We must not litter or scatter waste in public places.
*   If there is no dustbin in sight, carry the litter home and dispose of it properly.
*   A clean environment keeps us healthy and safe.

## Summary

*   Wastewater is used water from homes, industries, and other establishments. Sewage is a major component of wastewater containing various impurities.
*   Cleaning wastewater is crucial to prevent water pollution and the spread of diseases. This process is carried out at a Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP).
*   The WWTP process involves physical (screening, sedimentation), biological (aeration, sludge digestion), and chemical (disinfection) stages.
*   Good housekeeping practices, like not disposing of oils and solids in drains, can help maintain the sewerage system.
*   Poor sanitation leads to water-borne diseases. Alternative, low-cost sanitation systems like septic tanks and composting toilets are vital where sewerage systems are absent.
*   As active citizens, we have a responsibility to maintain cleanliness in our homes and public places to ensure a healthy environment for everyone.
