# Chapter 2: Nutrition In Animals

## Introduction to Animal Nutrition

All living organisms, including animals, require food for growth, repair, and the functioning of the body. **Animal nutrition** includes the nutrient requirement, the mode of intake of food, and its utilisation in the body.

Food contains complex components like carbohydrates, which cannot be utilized directly. They need to be broken down into simpler substances. The process of breaking down complex components of food into simpler substances is called **digestion**.

### Steps in the Process of Nutrition

The process of nutrition in animals involves the following steps:

1.  **Ingestion:** The process of taking food into the body.
2.  **Digestion:** The breakdown of complex, insoluble food substances into simple, soluble substances.
3.  **Absorption:** The process by which the digested food passes into the blood vessels in the wall of the intestine.
4.  **Assimilation:** The process in which the absorbed food is used by the body for energy, growth, and repair.
5.  **Egestion:** The process of removing undigested waste material from the body.

## Different Ways of Taking Food

Different animals have different methods of ingesting food. The mode of feeding varies depending on the type of food the animal eats.

| Animal | Kind of Food | Mode of Feeding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Snail | Grass, leaves | Chewing |
| Ant | Insects, sugar | Chewing, scraping |
| Eagle | Flesh | Capturing and swallowing |
| Hummingbird | Nectar | Sucking |
| Lice | Blood | Sucking |
| Mosquito | Blood | Sucking |
| Butterfly | Nectar | Siphoning |
| Housefly | Decaying matter | Sponging |
| Starfish | Small animals | Capturing and swallowing |

## Digestion in Humans

The human digestive system is a complex network of organs responsible for breaking down food. It consists of the **alimentary canal** (digestive tract) and associated **secretory glands**.

### The Human Digestive System

The alimentary canal is a long, continuous tube that begins at the mouth (buccal cavity) and ends at the anus. It includes:
1.  The Mouth and Buccal Cavity
2.  Foodpipe (Oesophagus)
3.  Stomach
4.  Small Intestine
5.  Large Intestine
6.  Rectum and Anus

The main digestive glands are the salivary glands, the liver, and the pancreas.

### 1. The Mouth and Buccal Cavity

*   **Ingestion** starts here. Food is taken into the body through the mouth.
*   The mouth contains the tongue, teeth, and salivary glands.

#### Teeth
Teeth cut, tear, and grind the food into smaller pieces. This process is called **mastication** or chewing. Humans have four types of teeth:

| Type of Teeth | Number (in each jaw) | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Incisors | 4 | Cutting and biting |
| Canines | 2 | Piercing and tearing |
| Premolars | 4 | Chewing and grinding |
| Molars | 6 | Chewing and grinding |

#### Saliva and the Tongue
*   The **salivary glands** secrete **saliva**.
*   Saliva contains an enzyme called **salivary amylase**, which breaks down starch (a complex carbohydrate) into simpler sugars.
*   The **tongue** is a muscular organ that helps in mixing food with saliva, swallowing the food, and detecting different tastes (sweet, sour, salty, bitter).

### 2. The Foodpipe (Oesophagus)

*   The swallowed food passes into the foodpipe or oesophagus.
*   The food is pushed down by the movement of the wall of the foodpipe. This wave-like muscular movement is called **peristalsis**.
*   No digestion takes place here.

### 3. The Stomach

*   The stomach is a thick-walled, J-shaped bag.
*   The inner lining of the stomach secretes three things:
    1.  **Mucus:** Protects the lining of the stomach from the acid.
    2.  **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl):** Kills bacteria that enter with the food and makes the medium in the stomach acidic, which helps digestive enzymes to act.
    3.  **Digestive Juices (Pepsin):** The enzyme pepsin begins the digestion of **proteins** into simpler substances.

### 4. The Small Intestine

*   It is a highly coiled tube, about 7.5 meters long.
*   It is the site of **complete digestion** of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.
*   It receives secretions from the liver and the pancreas.

#### Secretions from Liver and Pancreas
*   **Liver:** The largest gland in the body. It secretes **bile juice**, which is stored in the **gall bladder**. Bile plays a crucial role in the digestion of **fats**.
*   **Pancreas:** A large cream-coloured gland located just below the stomach. It secretes **pancreatic juice** that acts on carbohydrates, fats, and proteins and changes them into simpler forms.

#### Absorption in the Small Intestine
*   The digested food is now ready to be absorbed into the blood.
*   The inner wall of the small intestine has thousands of finger-like outgrowths called **villi** (singular: villus).
*   These villi increase the surface area for the absorption of digested food.
*   The absorbed substances are transported via the blood vessels to different organs of the body where they are used to build complex substances such as proteins required by the body. This is called **assimilation**.

### 5. The Large Intestine

*   It is wider and shorter than the small intestine, about 1.5 meters in length.
*   Its main function is to absorb **water** and some **salts** from the undigested food material.

### 6. The Rectum and Anus

*   The remaining undigested waste passes into the **rectum** and remains there as semi-solid faeces.
*   The faecal matter is removed through the **anus** from time to time. This process is called **egestion**.

## Digestion in Grass-Eating Animals (Ruminants)

*   Animals like cows, buffaloes, and deer are called **ruminants**.
*   They quickly swallow the grass and store it in a part of the stomach called the **rumen**. Here, the food gets partially digested. This partially digested food is called **cud**.
*   Later, the cud returns to the mouth in small lumps, and the animal chews it. This process is called **rumination**.
*   Grass is rich in **cellulose**, a type of carbohydrate. Ruminants have a large sac-like structure between the small and large intestines where cellulose is digested by the action of certain bacteria, which are not present in humans.

## Feeding and Digestion in Amoeba

*   **Amoeba** is a microscopic single-celled organism found in pond water.
*   It has a cell membrane, a rounded nucleus, and many small bubble-like vacuoles.
*   Amoeba constantly changes its shape and position. It pushes out one or more finger-like projections, called **pseudopodia** or false feet, for movement and capture of food.
*   **Ingestion:** When it senses food, it pushes out pseudopodia around the food particle and engulfs it, forming a **food vacuole**.
*   **Digestion:** Digestive juices are secreted into the food vacuole to break down the food into simpler substances.
*   **Absorption & Assimilation:** The digested food is absorbed and used for growth, maintenance, and multiplication.
*   **Egestion:** The undigested residue is expelled outside by the vacuole.

## Summary

Animal nutrition involves ingestion, digestion, absorption, assimilation, and egestion. The human digestive system consists of the alimentary canal and secretory glands. Digestion begins in the mouth, continues in the stomach, and is completed in the small intestine, where nutrients are absorbed through villi. The large intestine absorbs water, and waste is egested through the anus. Ruminants like cows have a specialized stomach (rumen) to digest cellulose through a process called rumination. Microscopic organisms like Amoeba use pseudopodia to engulf food into a food vacuole for digestion.
