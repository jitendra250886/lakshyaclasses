# Chapter 10: Respiration In Organisms

## Why Do We Respire?

All living organisms are made up of microscopic units called **cells**. Each cell performs specific functions like nutrition, transport, excretion, and reproduction. To perform these functions, the cell needs energy. This energy is obtained from the food we eat.

During respiration, the food we eat is broken down in the cells, which releases energy. This process is called **cellular respiration**.

**Respiration** is the process of breaking down food (glucose) in the cells of an organism to release energy for carrying out various life processes.

## Cellular Respiration

Cellular respiration takes place inside the cells of all organisms. It involves the breakdown of glucose to release energy. It can be of two types:

### 1. Aerobic Respiration

This type of respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen. Here, glucose is completely broken down into carbon dioxide and water, releasing a large amount of energy. Most living organisms, including humans, undergo aerobic respiration.

`Glucose` ---(in the presence of Oxygen)---> `Carbon Dioxide` + `Water` + `Energy`

### 2. Anaerobic Respiration

This type of respiration occurs in the absence of oxygen. It is seen in organisms like yeast. In this process, glucose is partially broken down into alcohol and carbon dioxide, releasing a smaller amount of energy compared to aerobic respiration.

`Glucose` ---(in the absence of Oxygen)---> `Alcohol` + `Carbon Dioxide` + `Energy`

*   **Anaerobes:** Organisms that can survive in the absence of air are called anaerobes. Example: Yeast. Yeast is used in the wine and beer industry because it anaerobically respires to produce alcohol.

#### Anaerobic Respiration in Our Muscles

Sometimes, during heavy physical activities like running or cycling, our muscle cells respire anaerobically. The demand for energy is high, but the supply of oxygen is limited. This results in the partial breakdown of glucose into **lactic acid** and energy.

`Glucose (in muscles)` ---(in the absence of Oxygen)---> `Lactic Acid` + `Energy`

The accumulation of lactic acid in the muscles causes cramps. We get relief from cramps after a hot water bath or a massage, which improves blood circulation, increasing the oxygen supply to the muscle cells.

## Breathing

**Breathing** is the mechanism by which an organism takes in oxygen-rich air and gives out carbon dioxide-rich air. It is a physical process that involves two steps:

1.  **Inhalation:** The process of taking in air rich in oxygen.
2.  **Exhalation:** The process of giving out air rich in carbon dioxide.

A **breath** means one inhalation followed by one exhalation.

**Breathing Rate:** The number of times a person breathes in a minute is called the breathing rate.
*   An average adult human at rest breathes 15-18 times per minute.
*   During heavy exercise, the breathing rate can increase up to 25 times per minute.

## How Do We Breathe?

The human respiratory system consists of the nostrils, nasal cavity, windpipe (trachea), and lungs. The breathing mechanism is driven by the **rib cage** and a large muscular sheet called the **diaphragm**.

| Process | Rib Cage Movement | Diaphragm Movement | Effect on Chest Cavity | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inhalation** | Moves up and outwards | Moves down | Volume increases | Air rushes into the lungs |
| **Exhalation** | Moves down and inwards | Moves up to its original position | Volume decreases | Air is pushed out of the lungs |



## What Do We Breathe Out?

The air we inhale and exhale is a mixture of gases. However, their composition is different.

| Gas | Inhaled Air | Exhaled Air |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Oxygen** | 21% | 16.4% (some is used up) |
| **Carbon Dioxide**| 0.04% | 4.4% (produced during respiration) |
| **Water Vapour**| Less | More (saturated) |

We can test for the presence of carbon dioxide in exhaled air by blowing through a straw into limewater. The limewater turns milky, which is a characteristic test for CO₂.

## Breathing in Other Animals

Different animals have different mechanisms for breathing.

*   **Cockroaches and Insects:** They have small openings on the sides of their bodies called **spiracles**. These spiracles are connected to a network of air tubes called **tracheae**, which deliver oxygen directly to the cells.
*   **Earthworms:** They breathe through their skin. The skin of an earthworm is moist and slimy, which allows gases to pass through it easily.
*   **Fish:** They live in water and breathe through special organs called **gills**. Gills are projections of the skin that are well-supplied with blood vessels. They help in using oxygen dissolved in water.
*   **Frogs:** They can breathe through their moist skin when in water and through a pair of lungs when on land.

## Respiration in Plants

Like other living organisms, plants also respire to get energy from food. They take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide.

*   **Leaves:** Plants exchange gases through tiny pores on the surface of their leaves called **stomata**.
*   **Roots:** The root cells of a plant get oxygen from the air spaces present between the soil particles. This is why overwatering a plant is harmful, as it fills up these air spaces and prevents the roots from respiring.
*   **Stems:** In woody stems, gas exchange occurs through small pores called **lenticels**.

It is important to remember that **respiration in plants occurs throughout the day and night**, whereas photosynthesis occurs only during the day in the presence of sunlight.

## Summary

*   Respiration is essential for all living organisms as it releases energy from food.
*   **Aerobic respiration** uses oxygen to completely break down food, releasing a lot of energy.
*   **Anaerobic respiration** occurs without oxygen, releasing less energy. Yeast and our muscle cells (during heavy exercise) can respire anaerobically.
*   **Breathing** is the physical process of inhaling oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide.
*   In humans, the diaphragm and rib cage drive the mechanism of breathing.
*   Different animals have different organs for breathing, such as gills (fish), spiracles (insects), and moist skin (earthworms).
*   Plants respire through stomata in leaves and lenticels in stems. Root cells take in air from the soil.
