# Chapter 3: Fibre To Fabric

## Introduction

In Class 6, we learned about fibres obtained from plants, such as cotton and jute. In this chapter, we will explore fibres that come from animals. The two main animal fibres we will study are **wool** and **silk**.

Fibres are thin, thread-like structures that can be spun into yarn, which is then woven or knitted to make fabric.

*   **Natural Fibres:** These are obtained from natural sources, i.e., plants and animals.
    *   **Plant Fibres:** Cotton, Jute, Flax.
    *   **Animal Fibres:** Wool, Silk.
*   **Synthetic Fibres:** These are man-made fibres produced using chemicals. Examples include Nylon, Polyester, and Acrylic.

## Animal Fibres

### 1. Wool

Wool is a soft, warm fabric obtained from the fleece (hair) of animals like sheep, goats, yaks, and camels. These animals have a thick coat of hair that traps a lot of air. Since air is a poor conductor of heat, this coat keeps their bodies warm. We use this woolly fibre to make warm clothes like sweaters and shawls.

#### Animals that Yield Wool

| Animal | Type of Wool/Fibre | Region Found |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sheep** | The most common source of wool. | All over the world. |
| **Angora Goat** | Mohair | Hilly regions like Jammu & Kashmir. |
| **Kashmiri Goat** | Cashmere (Pashmina) | The underfur is soft and used for fine shawls. |
| **Yak** | Yak Wool | Tibet and Ladakh. |
| **Camel** | Camel Hair | Deserts. |
| **Llama & Alpaca** | Llama/Alpaca Wool | South America. |

**Selective Breeding:** Some breeds of sheep have only fine under-hair. Their parents are specially chosen to give birth to sheep that have only soft under-hair. This process of selecting parents to obtain special characteristics in their offspring is called **selective breeding**.

#### From Fibres to Wool: Processing Steps

The process of converting the fleece of sheep into woollen yarn involves several steps:

1.  **Shearing:** The process of removing the fleece of the sheep along with a thin layer of skin is called **shearing**. This is usually done during hot weather so that the sheep can survive without their protective coat of hair. It does not hurt the sheep, just like getting a haircut doesn't hurt us.

2.  **Scouring:** The sheared skin with hair is thoroughly washed in tanks to remove grease, dust, and dirt. This process is called **scouring**.

3.  **Sorting:** After scouring, the hairy skin is sent to a factory where hair of different textures is separated or sorted.

4.  **Removing Burrs:** The small, fluffy fibres, called burrs, are picked out from the hair. These are the same burrs that sometimes appear on our sweaters. The fibres are scoured again and dried.

5.  **Dyeing:** The natural fleece of sheep is usually white, brown, or black. The fibres are dyed in various colours to create colourful fabrics.

6.  **Rolling into Yarn:** The fibres are straightened, combed, and rolled into yarn. The longer fibres are made into wool for sweaters, and the shorter fibres are spun and woven into woollen cloth.



### 2. Silk

Silk is another important animal fibre. It is known for its lustre (shine) and fine quality. The rearing of silkworms for obtaining silk is called **sericulture**.

#### Life History of the Silk Moth

The silk moth goes through four distinct stages in its life cycle:

1.  **Egg:** The female silk moth lays hundreds of eggs at a time.
2.  **Larva (Caterpillar or Silkworm):** The eggs hatch into larvae called caterpillars or silkworms. They feed on mulberry leaves and grow in size.
3.  **Pupa:** When the caterpillar is ready to enter the next stage, it first weaves a net to hold itself. Then it swings its head from side to side, secreting a fibre made of protein. This fibre hardens on exposure to air and becomes the silk fibre. The caterpillar covers itself completely with this fibre, forming a protective casing called a **cocoon**. The caterpillar develops into a moth inside the cocoon.
4.  **Moth:** The fully developed moth emerges from the cocoon, and the life cycle begins again.

The silk yarn (thread) is obtained from the cocoon of the silk moth. The most common silk moth is the **mulberry silk moth**, which produces soft, elastic, and lustrous silk. Other varieties include Tussar silk, Muga silk, and Kosa silk, which are obtained from cocoons spun by different types of moths.

#### From Cocoon to Silk: Processing Steps

1.  **Rearing Silkworms:** Female silk moths lay eggs, which are stored carefully on strips of cloth or paper. The farmers keep the eggs under hygienic and suitable temperature and humidity conditions. The eggs are warmed to a suitable temperature for the larvae to hatch.
2.  **Feeding:** The larvae (silkworms) are kept in clean bamboo trays and fed freshly chopped mulberry leaves. They eat day and night and increase enormously in size.
3.  **Spinning Cocoons:** After 25 to 30 days, the silkworms stop eating and move to a tiny chamber of bamboo in the tray to spin cocoons.
4.  **Reeling the Silk:** The cocoons are collected and kept under the sun, boiled, or exposed to steam. This process kills the pupa inside and separates out the silk fibres. The process of taking out threads from the cocoon for use as silk is called **reeling the silk**.
5.  **Spinning:** The silk fibres from several cocoons are reeled together to form a stronger thread, which is then spun into silk threads. These threads are woven into silk cloth by weavers.

## Summary

*   Wool and silk are common **animal fibres**.
*   Wool is obtained from the fleece of sheep, goats, yaks, and other animals. The process involves **shearing**, **scouring**, **sorting**, **dyeing**, and **spinning**.
*   Silk is a protein fibre obtained from the cocoons of silkworms. The rearing of silkworms for silk production is called **sericulture**.
*   The life cycle of a silk moth includes four stages: egg, larva (silkworm), pupa (in a cocoon), and adult moth.
*   The process of obtaining silk from cocoons is called **reeling**. The reeled fibres are then spun into silk threads.
