# Chapter 16: Water: A Precious Resource

## Introduction: Water is Life

Water is essential for the existence of all living things. Without water, there would be no life on Earth. We use water for drinking, cooking, cleaning, agriculture, industries, and generating electricity. Although Earth is called the "Blue Planet" because of the abundance of water, the amount of fresh, usable water is very limited. This makes water an extremely precious resource that we must conserve.

**World Water Day** is celebrated on **22nd March** every year to raise awareness about the importance of conserving water.

## How Much Water is Available?

About 71% of the Earth's surface is covered with water. However, not all of this water is available for our use.

*   **Saltwater (Oceans and Seas):** Approximately 97% of the total water on Earth is saltwater. It is not fit for drinking, agriculture, or most industrial uses without expensive desalination processes.
*   **Freshwater:** Only about 3% of the Earth's water is freshwater.

### Distribution of Freshwater

Even this small amount of freshwater is not easily accessible.

| Location of Freshwater | Percentage of Total Freshwater |
| :--- | :--- |
| Glaciers and Ice Caps | ~68.7% |
| Groundwater | ~30.1% |
| Surface Water (Lakes, Rivers) | ~0.3% |
| Other (e.g., atmospheric water) | ~0.9% |

This means that only a tiny fraction (less than 1%) of the world's total water is readily available for us to use.

## Forms of Water

Water exists on Earth in three forms:

1.  **Solid:** As ice, snow, or frost. Found in glaciers, ice caps, and frozen grounds.
2.  **Liquid:** As water. Found in oceans, rivers, lakes, and underground.
3.  **Gas:** As water vapour. Present in the air around us.

These forms are interchangeable, and their continuous circulation leads to the water cycle.

## The Water Cycle

The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. This process ensures that water is naturally replenished. The main processes involved are:

1.  **Evaporation:** The process where liquid water heats up (mainly by the sun) and turns into a gas called water vapour, rising into the atmosphere.
2.  **Transpiration:** The process where plants release water vapour into the atmosphere from their leaves.
3.  **Condensation:** As the water vapour rises, it cools down and changes back into tiny liquid water droplets. These droplets come together to form clouds.
4.  **Precipitation:** When the clouds become too heavy with water droplets, the water falls back to the Earth in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail.
5.  **Infiltration:** Some of the water that falls on the land seeps into the ground. This process is called infiltration.
6.  **Runoff:** Water that does not seep into the ground flows over the surface into streams, rivers, lakes, and eventually back to the oceans.



## Groundwater: An Important Source

A significant portion of our freshwater needs is met by groundwater.

*   **Groundwater:** The water that seeps into the ground and gets collected in the spaces between soil particles and rocks.
*   **Water Table:** The upper level of the zone where the ground is saturated with water. The water table can rise or fall depending on rainfall and water usage.
*   **Infiltration:** The process by which rainwater and water from other sources seeps through the soil and fills the empty spaces and cracks deep below the ground. This process recharges the groundwater.
*   **Aquifer:** A layer of permeable rock, sand, or gravel underground that holds groundwater. We extract this water using hand pumps and tube wells.

## Depletion of the Water Table

The water table is decreasing at an alarming rate in many areas. This is because we are drawing out more water than is being replenished by natural processes. The main causes are:

1.  **Increasing Population:** More people mean a higher demand for water for drinking, cooking, and sanitation. It also leads to more construction, which reduces the open area for water to seep into the ground.
2.  **Industrialization:** All industries require large quantities of water for their processes. As the number of industries increases, so does the consumption of water.
3.  **Agricultural Activities:** Agriculture is a major consumer of water. Farmers often rely on groundwater for irrigation, especially in areas with irregular rainfall.
4.  **Deforestation:** Trees and forests play a vital role in the water cycle. They help water seep into the ground. Cutting down forests reduces the natural recharge of groundwater.
5.  **Scanty Rainfall:** Irregular or insufficient rainfall in an area for a long period can lead to a significant drop in the water table.

## Water Management

Water management is the planned development, distribution, and use of water resources to meet the demands for human and environmental needs.

### Traditional Methods
*   **Bawris:** These are traditional stepwells that were built to collect and store rainwater. They helped people cope with water shortages in ancient times.

### Modern Methods
*   **Rainwater Harvesting:** This is the technique of collecting and storing rainwater for later use, instead of letting it run off. Rainwater can be collected from rooftops and directed into a storage tank or allowed to seep into the ground to recharge the groundwater.
*   **Drip Irrigation:** This is a water-saving irrigation technique used in agriculture. Water is delivered slowly and directly to the roots of the plants through a network of pipes and tubes. This minimizes evaporation and wastage.

## Our Role in Water Conservation

Every individual can contribute to conserving water. We can adopt simple habits to become "water-wise".

*   **Turn off taps** immediately after use and while brushing your teeth or washing hands.
*   **Fix leaking taps** and pipes at home. A single leaking tap can waste thousands of litres of water per year.
*   **Use a bucket and mug** for bathing instead of taking long showers.
*   **Mop the floor** instead of washing it with running water.
*   **Reuse water** used for washing vegetables to water plants in the garden.
*   Promote rainwater harvesting in your community.

## Effect of Water Scarcity on Plants

Water scarcity has a severe impact on plant life.

*   Plants need water for **photosynthesis** to make their food.
*   Without sufficient water, plants **wilt** and cannot absorb nutrients from the soil.
*   Prolonged water scarcity leads to the **death of plants**, which results in the loss of green cover and forests.
*   This affects the entire ecosystem, as it disrupts the food chain and reduces the availability of oxygen.

## Summary

Water is a vital and limited resource essential for all life. Most of the Earth's water is saline, and only a tiny fraction of freshwater is accessible for use. The water cycle naturally replenishes water, but human activities like over-extraction for agriculture, industry, and domestic use are causing the depletion of the groundwater table. To combat water scarcity, we must practice effective water management techniques like rainwater harvesting and drip irrigation. Every individual can contribute by adopting simple water-saving habits in their daily life to conserve this precious resource for future generations.
