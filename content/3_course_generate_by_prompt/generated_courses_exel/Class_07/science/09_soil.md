# Chapter 9: Soil

## Introduction to Soil

Soil is the uppermost layer of the Earth's crust, which is a mixture of rock particles and organic matter (humus). It is one of the most important natural resources. Soil supports the growth of plants by holding the roots firmly and supplying water and nutrients. It is also home to many organisms like earthworms, bacteria, and fungi. Agriculture, which provides us with food, clothing, and shelter, is entirely dependent on the quality of the soil.

## Soil Profile

If we look at a vertical section of soil from the surface down to the underlying bedrock, we can see distinct layers. This is called the **soil profile**. Each layer, called a **horizon**, has a different texture, colour, depth, and chemical composition.

The main horizons are:
*   **A-Horizon (Topsoil):** This is the uppermost layer. It is dark in colour because it is rich in **humus** (decomposed organic matter) and minerals. The soil here is soft, porous, and can retain a lot of water. Plant roots grow mainly in this layer.
*   **B-Horizon (Subsoil or Middle Layer):** This layer lies just below the topsoil. It has a lesser amount of humus but is rich in minerals that have seeped down from the topsoil. It is generally harder and more compact than the topsoil.
*   **C-Horizon:** Below the B-horizon is the C-horizon, which is made up of small lumps of rocks with cracks and crevices. It is formed from the partial weathering of the parent rock.
*   **Bedrock (Parent Rock):** This is the bottom-most layer. It is a solid, unweathered rock that is hard and difficult to dig with a spade.



## How is Soil Formed?

Soil is formed by the breaking down of rocks into smaller particles through a very slow process called **weathering**.

*   **Weathering:** This is the process where large rocks are broken down into smaller pieces by the action of natural forces like wind, water, ice, temperature changes, and the roots of plants.
*   This process takes thousands of years. The nature of the soil depends on the parent rock from which it has been formed and the type of vegetation that grows in it.

## Composition of Soil

Soil is a mixture of various components:
1.  **Rock Particles:** These are tiny pieces of weathered rock, which include gravel, sand, silt, and clay.
2.  **Humus:** This is the dark-coloured, organic matter formed from dead and decaying plants and animals. Humus makes the soil fertile and improves its water-holding capacity.
3.  **Water:** Soil contains water in the spaces between its particles.
4.  **Air:** Air is also trapped in the spaces between soil particles, which is essential for the roots of plants and other soil organisms to breathe.
5.  **Living Organisms:** Soil is home to countless organisms like bacteria, fungi, algae, protozoa, earthworms, insects, and rodents. Earthworms are often called 'farmer's friends' because they help to turn and loosen the soil.

## Types of Soil

Soil is classified into different types based on the proportion of particles of various sizes. The main types are:

1.  **Sandy Soil:**
    *   Contains a greater proportion of large sand particles.
    *   Particles are large with big spaces between them.
    *   It is well-aerated but cannot hold much water, as water drains through it quickly.
    *   It is light, easy to plough, and not very fertile.
    *   Found in deserts and on seashores.

2.  **Clayey Soil:**
    *   Contains a greater proportion of very fine clay particles.
    *   Particles are tightly packed with very little space for air.
    *   It has a very good water-holding capacity.
    *   It is heavy and becomes sticky when wet.
    *   It is rich in organic matter and is very fertile. It is used for making pots, toys, and statues.

3.  **Loamy Soil:**
    *   It is a mixture of sand, clay, and another type of soil particle called **silt**.
    *   It has the right balance of particle sizes, giving it good aeration and water-holding capacity.
    *   It is rich in humus and is considered the best soil for growing most crops.

### Comparison of Soil Types

| Property | Sandy Soil | Clayey Soil | Loamy Soil |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Particle Size** | Large | Very Fine | Mixture of sizes |
| **Air Spaces** | Large | Very Small | Moderate |
| **Water Retention** | Low | High | Optimal |
| **Nutrient Level** | Low | High | High |
| **Best for** | Crops like cactus, melon | Crops like wheat, rice, gram | Most vegetables and crops |

## Properties of Soil

### 1. Percolation Rate of Water
Percolation is the process of water seeping through the soil. The rate at which water percolates is different for different soil types.
*   Sandy soil has the **highest** percolation rate.
*   Clayey soil has the **lowest** percolation rate.

The percolation rate can be calculated using the formula:
**Percolation rate (mL/min) = Amount of water (mL) / Time taken for percolation (min)**

### 2. Moisture in Soil
Soil always contains some amount of water, which is called moisture. The amount of moisture depends on the soil type and the weather. Clayey soil retains the most moisture.

### 3. Absorption of Water by Soil
The capacity of a soil to hold water is an important property. Clayey and loamy soils have a high water-holding capacity, which is good for plant growth. Sandy soil has a very low water-holding capacity.

## Soil and Crops

Different types of soil are suitable for growing different types of crops. The choice of crop depends on the soil's properties, such as its texture, water-holding capacity, and nutrient content.

| Soil Type | Suitable Crops | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Clayey and Loamy Soil** | Wheat, Gram, Paddy (Rice) | Good water retention and rich in humus. |
| **Sandy-Loam Soil** | Cotton | Drains water easily and holds plenty of air. |
| **Loamy Soil** | Lentils (Masoor) and other pulses | Requires soil that drains water easily. |

## Soil Erosion

The removal of the fertile topsoil by natural forces like wind and water is called **soil erosion**.

**Causes of Soil Erosion:**
*   **Deforestation:** Cutting down trees on a large scale. Plant roots bind the soil together and prevent it from being washed or blown away.
*   **Overgrazing:** When cattle graze on the same land repeatedly, they remove the grass cover, exposing the soil.
*   **Strong Winds and Heavy Rains:** These are natural agents that carry away the topsoil, especially in areas with little or no vegetation.
*   **Floods:** Rushing floodwaters can wash away large amounts of topsoil.

**Prevention of Soil Erosion:**
*   **Afforestation:** Planting more trees is the most effective way to prevent soil erosion.
*   **Terrace Farming:** Cutting steps into hillsides to create flat areas for farming. This slows down the flow of water.
*   **Building Dams:** Dams can help control floods and reduce soil erosion caused by rivers.
*   **Preventing Overgrazing:** Managing grazing areas helps maintain the grass cover.

## Summary
Soil is a vital natural resource essential for life on Earth. It is formed by the weathering of rocks over thousands of years. A soil profile shows different layers called horizons (A, B, C, and Bedrock). Soil is composed of rock particles, humus, water, air, and living organisms. The main types of soil are sandy, clayey, and loamy, each with unique properties like percolation rate and water-holding capacity. Different crops require different types of soil. Soil erosion, the removal of topsoil, is a major problem caused by deforestation and other factors, but it can be prevented by planting trees and adopting better farming practices.
