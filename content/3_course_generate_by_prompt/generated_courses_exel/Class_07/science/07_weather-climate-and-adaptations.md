# Chapter 7: Weather, Climate and Adaptations

## Introduction
The world around us experiences different atmospheric conditions. Sometimes it's sunny, sometimes it's rainy, and sometimes it's cold. These conditions affect our daily lives, from the clothes we wear to the activities we plan. In this chapter, we will explore the concepts of weather and climate, and how living organisms, especially animals, have developed special features to survive in their specific climatic conditions.

## Weather
**Weather** refers to the day-to-day condition of the atmosphere at a particular place with respect to elements like temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed, etc.

*   **Short-term:** Weather is a short-term phenomenon. It can change rapidly, even within a few hours. For example, a sunny morning can suddenly turn into a cloudy and rainy afternoon.
*   **Complex Phenomenon:** Weather is very complex and can be difficult to predict accurately over long periods.
*   **Weather Reports:** The **Meteorological Department** of the government collects data on various weather elements and prepares daily weather reports. These reports are published in newspapers and broadcast on radio and television.

### Elements of Weather
The primary elements that determine the weather of a place are:

1.  **Temperature:** The degree of hotness or coldness of the air. It is measured using a **thermometer**. Special thermometers called **maximum and minimum thermometers** are used to record the highest and lowest temperatures of the day.
2.  **Humidity:** The amount of moisture or water vapour present in the air. High humidity makes us feel sweaty and uncomfortable. It is measured by an instrument called a **hygrometer**.
3.  **Rainfall:** The amount of rain that falls in a particular area. It is measured by an instrument called a **rain gauge**.
4.  **Wind Speed:** The speed at which the air is moving. It is measured by an instrument called an **anemometer**.

All changes in the weather are primarily caused by the **sun**. The sun is a huge sphere of hot gases at a very high temperature, and it is the primary source of all heat and light on Earth.

## Climate
**Climate** is the average weather pattern taken over a long period, typically 25 years or more. It gives us a general idea of the weather conditions that can be expected in a particular region throughout the year.

*   **Long-term:** Unlike weather, climate is a long-term pattern and does not change from day to day.
*   **Examples:**
    *   The climate of Rajasthan is described as **hot and dry** because, for most of the year, the temperature is high and it receives very little rainfall.
    *   The climate of the North-East India is described as **wet** because it receives heavy rain for a major part of the year.

### Difference between Weather and Climate

| Feature | Weather | Climate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Time Period** | Describes the atmospheric conditions over a **short period** (day, week). | Describes the **average** weather pattern over a **long period** (25+ years). |
| **Variability** | Can change rapidly and frequently. | Remains relatively stable for many years. |
| **Area** | Relates to a smaller, specific area. | Relates to a larger region. |
| **Prediction** | Predicted by meteorologists based on current data. | Based on historical weather data collected over decades. |

## Climate and Adaptations
Animals live in diverse climatic conditions, from the freezing cold polar regions to the hot and humid tropical rainforests. To survive in these harsh conditions, animals have developed special features and habits over thousands of years. This process of developing features to improve survival in a specific environment is called **adaptation**.

We will study the adaptations of animals in two regions with extreme climates: the polar regions and the tropical rainforests.

### The Polar Regions
The polar regions (Arctic and Antarctic) are characterized by an extreme climate.

*   **Climate:** They are covered with snow and are very cold for most of the year. For six months the sun does not set at the poles, while for the other six months, the sun does not rise. Temperatures can be as low as –37°C in winter.

#### Adaptations of Polar Bears
*   **White Fur:** Provides excellent camouflage against the snowy background, protecting them from predators and helping them catch prey.
*   **Thick Fur:** They have two thick layers of fur which act as insulators, trapping air and keeping them warm.
*   **Layer of Fat (Blubber):** A thick layer of fat under their skin provides further insulation against the cold.
*   **Strong Sense of Smell:** Helps them to locate their prey from a distance.
*   **Wide and Large Paws:** Help them to walk on the snow and also to swim efficiently.
*   **Long, Curved, and Sharp Claws:** Provide a good grip on the ice.

#### Adaptations of Penguins
*   **White and Black Body:** The white belly merges with the white snow, providing camouflage from predators in the water. The black back absorbs heat from the sun.
*   **Thick Skin and Blubber:** A thick layer of fat and thick skin protect them from the cold.
*   **Huddling (Behavioural Adaptation):** They huddle together in large groups to keep themselves warm.
*   **Streamlined Body and Webbed Feet:** These features make them excellent swimmers, which is essential for catching fish.

### The Tropical Rainforests
Tropical rainforests are found near the equator and are characterized by a hot and humid climate.

*   **Climate:** The temperature is generally high (around 15°C to 40°C). Days and nights are almost equal in length. They receive plenty of rainfall, making the region very humid.
*   **Biodiversity:** The favourable climate supports a huge variety of plants and animals. This leads to intense competition for food and shelter.

#### Adaptations of Animals in Tropical Rainforests
*   **Red-Eyed Frog:** Has developed sticky pads on its feet to help it climb trees where it lives.
*   **Monkeys:** Have long tails for grasping branches. Their hands and feet are also adapted to hold onto branches firmly.
*   **Toucan:** Possesses a long, large beak which allows it to reach fruits on branches that are too weak to support its weight.
*   **Lion-tailed Macaque (Beard Ape):** It is an excellent climber and spends most of its life on trees. It feeds on fruits, seeds, young leaves, stems, flowers, and insects. Its silver-white mane, which surrounds its head, is its most prominent feature.
*   **Elephant:** Has adapted in remarkable ways:
    *   **Trunk:** Used as a nose for its strong sense of smell and also for picking up food.
    *   **Tusks:** These are modified teeth used to tear the bark of trees, which the elephant loves to eat.
    *   **Large Ears:** Help it to hear even very soft sounds. They also help the elephant to keep cool in the hot and humid climate by flapping them.

## Summary
*   **Weather** is the short-term, day-to-day atmospheric condition of a place.
*   **Climate** is the long-term average weather pattern of a region, typically over 25 years.
*   The main elements of weather are temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed.
*   **Adaptation** is the process by which animals develop special physical features and behaviours to survive in their specific climate.
*   Animals in **polar regions**, like polar bears and penguins, have adaptations like thick fur, blubber, and camouflage to survive extreme cold.
*   Animals in **tropical rainforests**, like monkeys, toucans, and elephants, have adaptations to cope with competition for food and to live in a dense forest environment.
