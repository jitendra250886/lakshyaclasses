# Chapter 15: Light

## Introduction to Light

Light is a form of energy that enables us to see the world around us. We see objects when light from a source (like the sun or a bulb) falls on them and then bounces off, or reflects, into our eyes.

### Light Travels Along a Straight Line

One of the most fundamental properties of light is that it travels in a straight line. This is called the **rectilinear propagation of light**.

*   **Activity:** If you light a candle and look at it through a straight pipe, you can see the flame. However, if you try to look at it through a bent pipe, you cannot see the flame. This simple activity demonstrates that light travels in a straight path.
*   **Real-world examples:** The sharp shadows cast by objects and the beams of light from a projector or a car's headlights all show that light travels in a straight line.

## Reflection of Light

When light falls on a polished or shiny surface, it changes its direction. This bouncing back of light from a surface is called **reflection**.

*   **Mirror:** A smooth, highly polished surface that reflects most of the light falling on it is called a mirror.

### Image Formation by a Plane Mirror

A plane mirror is a mirror with a flat reflective surface. The image you see in a plane mirror has specific characteristics:

1.  **Virtual:** The image cannot be formed on a screen. It appears to be *behind* the mirror.
2.  **Erect:** The image is upright, just like the object.
3.  **Same Size:** The size of the image is the same as the size of the object.
4.  **Same Distance:** The image is formed at the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front of it.
5.  **Laterally Inverted:** The right side of the object appears as the left side of the image, and vice versa. This is why the word "AMBULANCE" is written in reverse on the front of ambulance vehicles, so drivers can read it correctly in their rearview mirrors.

## Spherical Mirrors

Spherical mirrors are mirrors whose reflecting surfaces are part of a sphere. They are curved mirrors. There are two types of spherical mirrors:

1.  **Concave Mirror:** The reflecting surface is curved inwards, like the inside of a spoon. It is also called a **converging mirror** because it brings parallel rays of light together (converges them) at a point.
2.  **Convex Mirror:** The reflecting surface is curved outwards, like the back of a spoon. It is also called a **diverging mirror** because it spreads out the light rays that fall on it.

### Image and Its Types

*   **Image:** An image is formed where the light rays reflected from a mirror (or refracted through a lens) meet or appear to meet.
*   **Real Image:** An image that can be formed on a screen (like a cinema screen). It is always inverted (upside down). Concave mirrors can form real images.
*   **Virtual Image:** An image that cannot be formed on a screen. It is always erect (upright). Plane mirrors, convex mirrors, and concave mirrors (when the object is very close) form virtual images.

| Feature | Real Image | Virtual Image |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Formation** | Formed when light rays actually meet after reflection. | Formed when light rays appear to meet after reflection. |
| **Screen** | Can be obtained on a screen. | Cannot be obtained on a screen. |
| **Orientation** | Always inverted (upside down). | Always erect (upright). |
| **Example** | Image formed on a cinema screen. | Image formed by a plane mirror. |

### Uses of Spherical Mirrors

| Mirror Type | Properties | Uses |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Concave Mirror** | Can form a magnified, real, or virtual image. | - As shaving mirrors and makeup mirrors (to see a larger image of the face).<br>- By dentists to see an enlarged image of teeth.<br>- As reflectors in torches, searchlights, and vehicle headlights to get a powerful, parallel beam of light. |
| **Convex Mirror** | Always forms a virtual, erect, and diminished (smaller) image. | - As rearview mirrors (side mirrors) in vehicles because they give a wider field of view, allowing drivers to see traffic over a large area behind them. <br>- As security mirrors in shops and at sharp turns on roads. |

## Lenses

A lens is a transparent piece of glass or plastic with at least one curved surface. Lenses work on the principle of **refraction** (the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another).

There are two main types of lenses:

1.  **Convex Lens:** Thicker in the middle and thinner at the edges. It is a **converging lens** because it bends light rays inward and brings them to a single point (focus).
2.  **Concave Lens:** Thinner in the middle and thicker at the edges. It is a **diverging lens** because it bends light rays outward, spreading them apart.

### Image Formation by Lenses

*   **Convex Lens:** Can form both real, inverted images and virtual, erect, magnified images. A magnifying glass is a simple convex lens.
*   **Concave Lens:** Always forms a virtual, erect, and diminished (smaller) image.

## Sunlight: White or Coloured?

Sunlight, which appears white to us, is actually a mixture of seven different colours. This can be demonstrated in several ways.

### The Prism

When a beam of white light is passed through a glass prism, it splits into a band of seven colours. This band of colours is called a **spectrum**. The seven colours are Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red (remembered by the acronym **VIBGYOR**). This splitting of white light into its constituent colours is called **dispersion**.

### The Rainbow

A rainbow is a natural phenomenon that shows the dispersion of sunlight. It is formed when sunlight passes through tiny raindrops in the atmosphere. These raindrops act like small prisms, splitting the sunlight into the seven colours of the spectrum. A rainbow is always formed in the direction opposite to that of the Sun.

### Newton's Disc

If you paint the seven colours of the spectrum on a circular cardboard disc and rotate it very fast, the colours blend together, and the disc appears whitish. This is called Newton's disc and it demonstrates that white light is composed of seven colours.

## Summary

*   Light travels in a straight line, a property known as rectilinear propagation.
*   Reflection is the bouncing of light from a shiny surface.
*   A plane mirror forms a virtual, erect, same-sized, and laterally inverted image.
*   Spherical mirrors are of two types: concave (converging) and convex (diverging).
*   Concave mirrors have various uses, including in torches and by dentists, while convex mirrors are used as rearview mirrors in vehicles.
*   Images can be real (can be formed on a screen, inverted) or virtual (cannot be formed on a screen, erect).
*   Lenses work by refracting light. Convex lenses are converging, and concave lenses are diverging.
*   Sunlight, or white light, is a mixture of seven colours (VIBGYOR).
*   A prism can split white light into its seven constituent colours through a process called dispersion. A rainbow is a natural example of this phenomenon.
