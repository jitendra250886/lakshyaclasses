# Chapter 5: Acids, Bases, and Salts

We use many substances in our daily life, such as lemon, sugar, salt, and vinegar. Some of these taste sour, some bitter, some sweet, and some salty. In science, we can classify many of these edible substances as acids or bases based on their taste and chemical properties.

## Acids
The word 'acid' comes from the Latin word *acere*, which means sour. Acids are chemical substances that have a characteristic sour taste.

**Properties of Acids:**
*   They are **sour** in taste.
*   They are **corrosive** in nature, which means they can damage surfaces like metal, stone, and even skin.
*   They turn **blue litmus paper red**.

**Examples of Acids in Daily Life:**

| Acid Name | Found In |
| :--- | :--- |
| Acetic Acid | Vinegar |
| Formic Acid | Ant's sting |
| Citric Acid | Citrus fruits like oranges, lemons |
| Lactic Acid | Curd |
| Oxalic Acid | Spinach |
| Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) | Amla, Citrus fruits |
| Tartaric Acid | Tamarind, grapes, unripe mangoes |

The acids mentioned above are **natural acids** and are generally weak. Acids used in laboratories, like Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) and Sulphuric Acid (H₂SO₄), are strong acids and must be handled with great care.

## Bases
Bases are chemical substances that are opposite to acids.

**Properties of Bases:**
*   They are **bitter** in taste.
*   They feel **soapy or slippery** to the touch.
*   They turn **red litmus paper blue**.

**Examples of Bases in Daily Life:**

| Base Name | Found In |
| :--- | :--- |
| Calcium Hydroxide | Lime water |
| Ammonium Hydroxide | Window cleaner |
| Sodium Hydroxide / Potassium Hydroxide | Soap |
| Magnesium Hydroxide | Milk of magnesia (antacid) |

## Indicators
We cannot taste every substance to find out if it is an acid or a base, as some can be harmful. Instead, we use special substances called **indicators**.

An **indicator** is a substance that changes its colour when it is added to an acidic or a basic solution.

### Natural Indicators
These are indicators obtained from natural sources.

1.  **Litmus:** The most commonly used natural indicator. It is extracted from **lichens**.
    *   In an acidic solution, it turns **red**.
    *   In a basic solution, it turns **blue**.
    *   It is available as a solution or in the form of paper strips (litmus paper).

2.  **Turmeric (Haldi):** It is a common spice.
    *   It remains **yellow** in acidic and neutral solutions.
    *   It turns **red** in a basic solution. (You may have noticed a curry stain on a white shirt turning reddish-brown when washed with soap, which is basic).

3.  **China Rose Petals (Gudhal):** The indicator is prepared by keeping the petals in warm water.
    *   It turns an acidic solution to **dark pink (magenta)**.
    *   It turns a basic solution to **green**.

### Indicator Colour Changes

| Indicator | Colour in Acidic Solution | Colour in Basic Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Blue Litmus | Red | Blue (No Change) |
| Red Litmus | Red (No Change) | Blue |
| Turmeric | Yellow | Red |
| China Rose | Dark Pink (Magenta) | Green |
| Phenolphthalein (Lab Indicator) | Colourless | Pink |

## Neutralisation
The reaction between an acid and a base is known as a **neutralisation reaction**. In this process, the acidic and basic nature of the substances are destroyed (neutralised).

*   **Products:** Salt and water are always produced in this reaction.
*   **Heat:** Heat is always evolved or released during neutralisation.

The general equation for the reaction is:
**Acid + Base → Salt + Water + Heat**

**Example:**
When Hydrochloric acid (HCl) reacts with Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a base, they form Sodium chloride (NaCl), which is a common salt, and water.

`HCl (Acid) + NaOH (Base) → NaCl (Salt) + H₂O (Water) + Heat`

## Neutralisation in Everyday Life

1.  **Indigestion:** Our stomach produces hydrochloric acid to digest food. Too much acid causes pain and irritation (indigestion). To relieve this, we take an **antacid** like Milk of Magnesia, which contains magnesium hydroxide (a base). It neutralises the effect of the excessive acid.

2.  **Ant Bite:** When an ant bites, it injects **formic acid** into the skin. This causes a burning sensation. The effect can be neutralised by rubbing a mild base like moist **baking soda** (sodium hydrogen carbonate) or **calamine solution** (containing zinc carbonate).

3.  **Soil Treatment:** Plants do not grow well if the soil is too acidic or too basic.
    *   If the soil is too **acidic**, it is treated with bases like **quicklime** (calcium oxide) or **slaked lime** (calcium hydroxide).
    *   If the soil is too **basic**, organic matter (compost) is added. The organic matter releases acids as it decomposes, neutralising the soil.

4.  **Factory Wastes:** The waste from many factories contains acids. If this waste is released into water bodies, the acids can kill fish and other organisms. Therefore, factory wastes are treated with basic substances to neutralise them before they are discharged.

## Summary
*   **Acids** are sour, corrosive, and turn blue litmus red. Examples include lemon juice and vinegar.
*   **Bases** are bitter, feel soapy, and turn red litmus blue. Examples include soap and baking soda.
*   **Indicators** are substances that show different colours in acidic and basic solutions, helping us identify them.
*   A **neutralisation** reaction occurs when an acid and a base react, forming **salt** and **water**, and releasing heat.
*   Neutralisation has many important applications in our daily lives, from treating indigestion and ant bites to managing soil health and industrial waste.
