# Chapter 11: Transportation In Animals And Plants

## Introduction
All living organisms, including animals and plants, need a transport system to carry essential substances like food, water, and oxygen to all their cells. This system also helps in removing waste products generated by the cells. In this chapter, we will learn about the systems responsible for this transportation in both animals and plants.

## 1. Circulatory System in Animals
The circulatory system is the organ system responsible for transporting substances to and from the cells. In humans and most animals, it consists of the heart, blood vessels, and blood.

### 1.1 Blood
Blood is a red-coloured fluid that flows in blood vessels. It acts as the medium for transporting substances throughout the body.

**Functions of Blood:**
*   It transports digested food from the small intestine to all parts of the body.
*   It carries oxygen from the lungs to the body's cells.
*   It transports waste products for removal from the body.

**Components of Blood:**
*   **Plasma:** The liquid part of the blood, which is yellowish in colour. It contains water, nutrients, hormones, and waste products. Blood cells are suspended in the plasma.
*   **Red Blood Cells (RBCs):** These cells contain a red pigment called **haemoglobin**. Haemoglobin binds with oxygen and transports it to all the cells of the body. The presence of haemoglobin gives blood its red colour.
*   **White Blood Cells (WBCs):** These cells are the body's soldiers. They fight against germs and protect us from infections.
*   **Platelets:** These are tiny cell fragments that help in the clotting of blood. When you get a cut, platelets form a clot to stop the bleeding.

### 1.2 Blood Vessels
Blood vessels are a network of tubes that carry blood throughout the body. There are three main types:

*   **Arteries:** They carry oxygen-rich blood **away** from the heart to all parts of the body. The blood flow is rapid and at high pressure, so arteries have thick, elastic walls.
    *   *Exception:* The **pulmonary artery** carries carbon dioxide-rich blood from the heart to the lungs.
*   **Veins:** They carry carbon dioxide-rich blood **towards** the heart from all parts of the body. The walls of veins are thinner than arteries. They have **valves** that allow blood to flow only towards the heart and prevent it from flowing backward.
    *   *Exception:* The **pulmonary vein** carries oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the heart.
*   **Capillaries:** These are extremely thin blood vessels that connect arteries to veins. Their thin walls allow the exchange of food, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other waste products between the blood and the body cells.

| Feature | Arteries | Veins |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direction of Flow** | Away from the heart | Towards the heart |
| **Type of Blood** | Oxygen-rich (except pulmonary artery) | CO₂-rich (except pulmonary vein) |
| **Wall Thickness** | Thick and elastic | Thin |
| **Valves** | Absent | Present |
| **Pressure** | High | Low |

**Pulse and Pulse Rate:**
The rhythmic expansion and contraction of arteries each time the heart pumps blood into them is called a **pulse**. The number of pulse beats per minute is the **pulse rate**. A normal resting pulse rate for a healthy person is between 72 and 80 beats per minute.

### 1.3 Heart
The heart is a muscular organ that acts as a pump, continuously pumping blood to all parts of the body.

*   **Location:** It is located in the chest cavity, with its lower tip slightly tilted towards the left.
*   **Chambers:** The human heart has four chambers.
    *   The two upper chambers are called the **atria** (singular: atrium).
    *   The two lower chambers are called the **ventricles**.
*   **Function:** A partition called the **septum** separates the right side from the left side, preventing the mixing of oxygen-rich and carbon dioxide-rich blood.
    1.  CO₂-rich blood from the body enters the **right atrium**.
    2.  It is then pumped into the **right ventricle**.
    3.  The right ventricle pumps this blood to the **lungs** for oxygenation.
    4.  Oxygen-rich blood from the lungs enters the **left atrium**.
    5.  It is then pumped into the **left ventricle**.
    6.  The left ventricle pumps the oxygen-rich blood to the **rest of the body**.



**Heartbeat:** The rhythmic contraction and relaxation of the heart muscles constitute a heartbeat. A doctor uses a **stethoscope** to listen to your heartbeat.

## 2. Excretion in Animals
Excretion is the process of removing waste products produced in the cells of living organisms. The parts involved in excretion form the **excretory system**.

### 2.1 Human Excretory System
The main waste product in humans is **urea**. The human excretory system removes this waste from the blood.

*   **Kidneys:** Two bean-shaped organs that filter the blood. As blood passes through the kidneys, useful substances are reabsorbed, and waste products like urea are removed, forming urine.
*   **Ureters:** Two tube-like structures that carry urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder.
*   **Urinary Bladder:** A muscular sac that stores urine temporarily.
*   **Urethra:** A muscular tube through which urine is passed out of the body.

An adult human normally passes about 1–1.8 L of urine in 24 hours. Urine consists of 95% water, 2.5% urea, and 2.5% other waste products.

**Dialysis:** When a person's kidneys stop working due to infection or injury (kidney failure), waste products accumulate in the blood. Such a person cannot survive unless their blood is filtered periodically using an artificial kidney. This process is called **dialysis**.

## 3. Transportation in Plants
Plants also have a transport system to move water, minerals, and food to their different parts. This is done by special tissues called **vascular tissues**.

### 3.1 Transport of Water and Minerals
*   **Absorption:** Plants absorb water and minerals from the soil through their **roots**, specifically through **root hairs**. Root hairs increase the surface area for absorption.
*   **Xylem:** This is a vascular tissue that forms a continuous network of channels connecting the roots to the leaves through the stem and branches. Xylem transports water and dissolved minerals upwards from the roots to the rest of the plant.

### 3.2 Transport of Food
*   **Photosynthesis:** Leaves prepare food for the plant through photosynthesis.
*   **Phloem:** This is another vascular tissue that transports the food prepared by the leaves to all other parts of the plant, including the roots. The transport of food from the leaves to other parts of the plant is called **translocation**.

### 3.3 Transpiration
Transpiration is the process by which plants release excess water in the form of water vapour through small pores called **stomata**, which are usually located on the underside of the leaves.

**Functions of Transpiration:**
1.  **Cooling Effect:** Evaporation of water from the leaves cools the plant.
2.  **Transpirational Pull:** It creates a suction pull, similar to sucking water through a straw. This pull helps to draw water up from the roots to great heights in tall trees.

## Summary
*   The **circulatory system** in animals consists of the **heart**, **blood vessels** (arteries, veins, capillaries), and **blood** (plasma, RBCs, WBCs, platelets).
*   Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart, while veins carry deoxygenated blood towards the heart.
*   The **heart** is a four-chambered pump that circulates blood throughout the body.
*   **Excretion** is the removal of metabolic waste. The human **excretory system** includes the **kidneys**, **ureters**, **urinary bladder**, and **urethra**.
*   Plants have vascular tissues for transportation: **xylem** for water and minerals, and **phloem** for food.
*   **Transpiration** is the loss of water vapour from leaves, which helps in cooling the plant and pulling water up from the roots.
