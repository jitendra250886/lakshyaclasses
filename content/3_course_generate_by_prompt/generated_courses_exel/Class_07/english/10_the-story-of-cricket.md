# Notes for Class 7 English - Chapter 10: The Story Of Cricket

## Part I: The Origins and Early History of Cricket

Cricket is a unique game in many ways. Unlike other team sports like hockey or football, the rules for the size of the playing area are not fixed. However, other aspects of the game, like the size of the ball and the length of the pitch, are clearly defined.

### How Cricket Began
*   **Origin:** Cricket grew out of the many "stick-and-ball" games played in England over 500 years ago. The word 'bat' is an old English word that simply means stick or club.
*   **Early Equipment:**
    *   **The Bat:** Initially, the bat was shaped like a hockey stick, with a curve at the bottom. This was because the ball was bowled underarm, rolling along the ground.
    *   **The Wicket:** The first wickets were just two stumps.
*   **Evolution of the Game:**
    *   The invention of the straight bat was a result of bowlers starting to pitch the ball through the air. This allowed batsmen to play more powerful and timed shots.
    *   A third stump was added to the wicket.
    *   Over-arm bowling became common around the 1760s and 1770s.

### The First Rules and Clubs
*   **First Laws of Cricket:** The first written rules of the game, called the "Laws of Cricket," were drawn up in 1744. They established the basics of the game, such as the length of the pitch (22 yards) and the weight of the ball (between 5 ½ to 5 ¾ ounces).
*   **First Cricket Clubs:**
    *   The **Hambledon Club** was the first major cricket club, founded in the 1760s.
    *   The **Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC)** was founded in 1787. It quickly became the guardian of cricket's laws and its authority is still recognized today.

## Part II: Cricket and Society

Cricket's history is closely tied to the social and political history of England.

### A Game of Gentlemen and Players
In 19th-century England, cricket was divided along social lines.
*   **The Amateurs (Gentlemen):** These were wealthy men who played for fun and leisure. They were called "Gentlemen."
*   **The Professionals (Players):** These were poorer men who played cricket for a living and were paid for it. They were called "Players."

This class distinction was visible in many ways:
*   Gentlemen were often the captains of the teams.
*   Players and Gentlemen used separate entrances to the pavilion.
*   The "Gentlemen" were addressed as "Mr.", while the "Players" were called by their last names.

### The Spread of Cricket
*   The British Empire was the main reason for the spread of cricket across the world.
*   The game was introduced in the colonies, but it was often played exclusively by the white settlers or the local elites who wanted to copy their colonial masters.
*   Cricket became a symbol of racial superiority in some colonies, where only white teams were allowed to play Test cricket.

## Part III: The Story of Cricket in India and the Modern Game

Cricket was brought to India by the British in the 18th century.

### The Beginning of Indian Cricket
*   **The Parsis:** The first Indian community to start playing cricket was the small community of Zoroastrians, the Parsis. They founded the first Indian cricket club, the **Oriental Cricket Club**, in Bombay in 1848.
*   **Communal Cricket:** In its early days, Indian cricket was organized on communal and religious lines. There were teams representing the Parsis, the Hindus, and the Muslims. This led to the famous **Pentangular tournament**, which was criticized by leaders like Mahatma Gandhi for dividing people.
*   **Overcoming Discrimination:** Early Indian cricketers like **Palwankar Baloo**, a Dalit, faced discrimination but proved their talent and challenged the idea that only upper-caste people could be good at the game.

### The Modern Transformation of Cricket
*   **Decolonisation:** After the Second World War, the balance of power in cricket began to shift. The **Imperial Cricket Conference** was renamed the **International Cricket Council (ICC)** in 1965, giving more power to non-English nations.
*   **The Television Revolution:**
    *   Television coverage made cricket accessible to millions of people, turning it into a global sport.
    *   It made cricketers celebrities and expanded the game's commercial reach.
*   **Kerry Packer's Influence:** In 1977, an Australian television tycoon named Kerry Packer started a rival cricket league. He introduced many innovations that are now a standard part of the game:
    *   Coloured uniforms
    *   Protective helmets
    *   Field restrictions
    *   Day-night matches under lights

### India: The New Centre of Cricket
*   Today, India has the largest viewership for cricket in the world, making it the game's biggest market.
*   The Indian cricket board (BCCI) is the richest and most powerful cricket board globally.
*   This shift in power from England and Australia to the Indian subcontinent is a symbol of the changing world.
