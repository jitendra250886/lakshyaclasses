## Chapter Overview

"Three Questions" is a short story by the renowned Russian author Leo Tolstoy. It tells the tale of a king who seeks answers to what he considers the three most important questions in life. His quest for wisdom leads him away from his court of learned men to a humble hermit in the woods.

### 1. The King's Quest for Answers

A certain king believed that if he always knew the answers to three specific questions, he would never fail in anything he undertook.

#### The Three Questions

The king's three questions were:
1.  **What is the right time to begin something?**
2.  **Which people should he listen to?**
3.  **What is the most important thing for him to do?**

The king sent messengers throughout his kingdom, promising a large sum of money to anyone who could provide satisfactory answers.

#### The Unsatisfactory Answers

Many wise men came to the court, but they all gave different answers.

| Question | Answers from the Wise Men |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. The right time?** | - One must prepare a strict timetable and follow it. <br> - It is impossible to decide the right time in advance. <br> - The king should have a council of wise men to help him fix the proper time. <br> - Only magicians could know the future and thus the right time. |
| **2. The right people?** | - The most necessary people were his councillors. <br> - Others said, the priests. <br> - A few others chose the doctors. <br> - And yet others said that his soldiers were the most necessary. |
| **3. The most important thing?** | - The most important business was science. <br> - Others said it was fighting. <br> - Still others said it was religious worship. |

The king was not satisfied with any of these answers because they were all different and conflicting. He decided not to give any reward and instead chose to seek the advice of a wise hermit, who was famous for his wisdom.

### 2. The Visit to the Hermit

The hermit lived in a small hut in the woods and only met common people. So, the king disguised himself as an ordinary man. He left his horse and bodyguards behind and went to the hermit's hut alone.

When the king arrived, he saw the hermit, who was old and weak, digging the ground in front of his hut.
- The king greeted the hermit and asked his three questions.
- The hermit listened but did not speak. He went on digging.
- Seeing the hermit was tired, the king offered to help him and began digging the beds for him.

Hours passed. The king, having dug two beds, repeated his questions. The hermit still did not answer and instead asked to take the spade back. The king, however, continued to dig.

### 3. The Wounded Man

Just as the sun was setting, a bearded man came running out of the woods.
- He was pressing his hands against his stomach, from which blood was flowing.
- He fainted and fell to the ground.
- The king and the hermit saw a large wound in his stomach.
- The king washed and covered the wound with his handkerchief, but the bleeding would not stop. He re-dressed the wound until the bleeding stopped at last.
- The king, with the hermit's help, carried the wounded man into the hut and laid him on the bed. The man closed his eyes and lay quiet. The king, tired from his walk and the work he had done, fell asleep on the floor.

### 4. The Revelation and Forgiveness

The next morning, the bearded man, now awake, asked for the king's forgiveness in a weak voice. The king was confused, as he did not know the man.

The man then revealed his identity:
- He was an enemy of the king who had sworn to take revenge because the king had executed his brother and seized his property.
- He knew the king had gone alone to see the hermit and had planned to kill him on his way back.
- When the king did not return, the man came out from his hiding place and was recognized and wounded by the king's bodyguards.
- He confessed that he would have died if the king had not dressed his wounds.
- Overcome with gratitude for the king's kindness, he promised to serve the king faithfully for the rest of his life.

The king was very happy to have made peace with his enemy so easily. He not only forgave the man but also promised to send his servants and his own doctor to look after him and to restore his property.

### 5. The Hermit's Wisdom: The Answers Found

Before leaving, the king went to find the hermit one last time to ask for the answers. He found the hermit sowing seeds in the beds they had dug the previous day.

The hermit explained that the king had already received his answers through his actions.

1.  **The most important time is "Now".**
    *   **Explanation:** The present moment is the only time we have any power to act. If the king had not pitied the hermit's weakness and dug the beds for him, he would have left and been attacked by his enemy. So, the most important time was when he was digging.

2.  **The most important person is the person you are with at a particular moment.**
    *   **Explanation:** No one knows what will happen in the future and whether we will meet anyone else. When the king was digging, the hermit was the most important person. When the wounded man arrived, he became the most important person.

3.  **The most important business is to do that person good.**
    *   **Explanation:** We are sent into this world for this purpose alone. The king's most important business was to help the hermit and then to care for the wounded man. By doing good to the wounded man, the king saved his own life and won over an enemy.

## Summary

A king seeks answers to three crucial questions about the right time, the right people, and the most important action. Dissatisfied with the advice from his court, he visits a wise hermit in disguise. By helping the hermit dig and later saving the life of a wounded man (who turns out to be his enemy), the king unknowingly lives out the answers. The hermit explains that the most important time is **now**, the most important person is **whoever you are with**, and the most important thing to do is **to do good for that person**. The story teaches the profound value of living in the present, showing compassion, and acting with kindness.
