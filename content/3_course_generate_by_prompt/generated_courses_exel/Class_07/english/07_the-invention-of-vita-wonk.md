### Part 1: The Problem with Wonka-Vite

Mr. Willy Wonka, a brilliant inventor, had previously created a tonic called **Wonka-Vite**. This tonic was incredibly powerful and could make people younger.

*   **The Problem:** The tonic was *too* powerful. Its effects were drastic and uncontrollable.
*   **The Incident:** One volunteer who tried Wonka-Vite kept getting younger and younger until his age became **minus eighty-seven (-87)**. This meant he had to wait 87 years before he could be born and come back.
*   **The New Challenge:** After this disastrous result, Mr. Wonka realized he needed to create an antidote or an opposite potion. He decided he must invent something that makes people grow **older**.

### Part 2: The Quest for the Oldest Things

To create a potion that makes people older, Mr. Wonka logically concluded that he needed to collect parts from the oldest living things in the world. He told his assistant, Charlie, that he had to "track down" the oldest living creatures and plants.

He travelled all over the world in his **Great Glass Elevator** to collect a very special and strange list of items.

#### Mr. Wonka's Shopping List

Mr. Wonka collected a tiny bit of substance from each of the following ancient things:

*   Sap from a **4,000-year-old Bristlecone pine tree** (one of the oldest trees in the world).
*   Toenail clippings from a **168-year-old Russian farmer** named Petrovitch Gregorovitch.
*   An egg laid by a **200-year-old tortoise** belonging to the King of Tonga.
*   The tail of a **51-year-old horse** in Arabia.
*   The whiskers of a **36-year-old cat** called Crumpets.
*   A **flea** that had lived on the cat Crumpets for 36 years.
*   The tail of a **207-year-old giant rat** from Tibet.
*   The black teeth of a **97-year-old Grimalkin** (an old cat) living in a cave.
*   The knucklebones of a **700-year-old Cattaloo** from Peru.

### Part 3: The Creation and Testing of Vita-Wonk

After collecting all the items, Mr. Wonka returned to his Inventing Room.

1.  **The Process:** He boiled, bubbled, mixed, and tested all the ingredients in his laboratory. After a lot of hard work, he produced a single cupful of an oily, black liquid.
2.  **The Volunteer:** A brave, 20-year-old **Oompa-Loompa** volunteer agreed to test the new invention.
3.  **The Experiment:** Mr. Wonka gave just **four drops** of the oily black liquid to the Oompa-Loompa.
4.  **The Result:** The effect was immediate and dramatic!
    *   The Oompa-Loompa began to wrinkle and shrivel up all over.
    *   His hair started dropping off.
    *   His teeth started falling out.
    *   In a matter of moments, the 20-year-old Oompa-Loompa had turned into an old man of **75**.

Mr. Wonka was successful! He had invented **Vita-Wonk**.

### Character Sketch: Mr. Willy Wonka

*   **Brilliant Inventor:** He is highly intelligent and creative, capable of inventing magical potions like Wonka-Vite and Vita-Wonk.
*   **Determined:** When his first invention goes wrong, he doesn't give up. Instead, he sets a new goal and works tirelessly to achieve it.
*   **Eccentric and Adventurous:** His methods are unusual, and he travels the world in a glass elevator to collect strange ingredients. He is a fun and unpredictable character.
