## Plot Summary

The story is divided into two parts.

### Part I: The Treasure and the Tragedy

1.  **A Loving Home:** In 19th-century Japan, a kind, childless old couple loves their pet dog, Muko, as if he were their own baby. They feed him fish and boiled rice from their own chopsticks.

2.  **The Discovery of Treasure:** One day, Muko leads his master to a spot in the garden. The old man digs there and discovers a pile of gold coins. The couple becomes rich and shares their fortune with their poor neighbours.

3.  **The Neighbors' Greed:** Their wicked, greedy neighbours hear about this and become jealous. They borrow Muko, hoping the dog will find treasure for them too. They drag the unwilling dog into their garden. Muko, scared, scratches at a spot under a pine tree.

4.  **Cruelty and Death:** The greedy couple digs excitedly but only finds a dead kitten. Furious and disappointed, they kill Muko in a fit of rage.

5.  **The Spirit of Muko:** The kind old man is heartbroken. He buries Muko under the pine tree where he was killed. That night, the spirit of Muko appears in his master's dream. It tells him to cut down the pine tree and make a mortar and a hand-mill from its wood.

6.  **The Magic Mortar:** The old man does as instructed. When he and his wife use the mortar to make rice pastry, the pastry magically turns into a mass of gold coins. When they use the hand-mill to grind beans, it produces gold.

7.  **The Neighbors' Second Act of Greed:** The wicked neighbours see this and borrow the magic mortar and mill. However, when they try to use them, the pastry turns into a foul mass of worms. In anger, they chop the mortar and mill into pieces and burn them.

### Part II: The Magic Ashes

1.  **The Second Dream:** The spirit of Muko appears in his master's dream again. This time, it tells him to take the ashes of the burnt mortar, as they have magical powers.

2.  **The Power of the Ashes:** The old man collects the ashes. He decides to test them on a withered cherry tree in his garden. When he sprinkles a pinch of ash on it, the dead tree instantly sprouts blossoms and becomes beautiful.

3.  **Fame and the Daimio:** The old man becomes famous as "the man who could make dead trees bloom." The story reaches the ears of the *daimio*, a powerful feudal lord. The daimio is scheduled to pass by their village.

4.  **The Old Man's Success:** When the daimio's procession arrives, the old man climbs a withered cherry tree on the roadside. As the daimio passes, he sprinkles the ashes. The tree bursts into bloom, delighting the lord. The daimio rewards the old man with silk robes, cakes, fans, and other valuable gifts.

5.  **The Wicked Neighbor's Imitation:** The greedy neighbour sees this and decides to imitate the old man. He collects the remaining ashes and waits for the daimio's procession on the highway. He climbs a withered tree and, when the daimio is right under him, throws a handful of ashes over the tree.

6.  **The Punishment:** Instead of blooming, the ashes fly into the eyes and noses of the daimio and his wife, causing them to choke and sneeze. The lord's men seize the wicked man, beat him severely, and leave him for dead.

The kind old man and his wife, having been rewarded for their goodness, live a long and happy life.
