# Chapter 6: Expert Detectives

## Introduction

"Expert Detectives" is an engaging story about two young siblings, Maya and Nishad, who turn into amateur detectives. Their investigation is focused on their mysterious neighbour, Mr. Nath. The story beautifully captures the contrast between a child's imaginative suspicion and another's simple empathy, leaving the reader to ponder the truth.

## Character Sketch

*   **Maya:** A ten-year-old girl who is very imaginative and suspicious. She loves reading detective stories and sees herself as an expert detective. She is convinced that Mr. Nath is a criminal on the run (a "crook") and meticulously collects "facts" to prove her theory.
*   **Nishad (Seven):** Maya's seven-year-old brother. His nickname is "Seven" because his name means the seventh note on the musical scale. He is more compassionate and kind-hearted than his sister. He feels sorry for Mr. Nath and believes he is just a poor, lonely man who is sick.
*   **Mr. Nath:** The subject of the children's investigation. He is a mysterious man who lives alone, rarely speaks to anyone, and has burn scars on his face. The children's mother, a doctor, is treating him.
*   **Ramesh:** The boy who works at the restaurant downstairs. He delivers Mr. Nath's meals twice a day and is one of the few people who interacts with him.

## Plot Summary

The story follows the investigation led by Maya and her reluctant assistant, Nishad, into the life of their neighbour, Mr. Nath.

### The Beginning of the Investigation

The children are fascinated by Mr. Nath because he is so different from everyone else. He has been living in Shankar House for over a year but has no friends and never talks to anyone. Their mother, a doctor, knows him as a patient and describes him as polite. This only adds to the mystery.

### Maya's Theory: Mr. Nath is a Crook

Maya, the "expert detective," is certain that Mr. Nath is a criminal. She creates a list of facts to support her theory:
1.  **His Name:** She thinks his name, Mr. Nath, is probably fake.
2.  **No Friends:** He doesn't talk to anyone and has no friends.
3.  **No Work:** He stays in his room all day and doesn't seem to work.
4.  **Mysterious Visitor:** A man visits him every Sunday for lunch. Maya suspects this man is his partner in crime.
5.  **Food Habits:** He orders the same meal every day (two chapattis, dal, and a vegetable) from the restaurant downstairs, delivered by Ramesh.
6.  **Money:** He pays his bills in cash and tips Ramesh well, making Maya wonder where he gets the money from.
7.  **Scars:** She believes the burn scars on his face are from a shootout with the police.

### Nishad's Counter-Argument

Nishad disagrees with his sister's harsh conclusions. He presents a more sympathetic view of Mr. Nath:
*   He thinks Mr. Nath looks poor and is starving, not a rich criminal.
*   He suggests that the scars might be from a fire, not a gunfight.
*   He points out that their mother, a doctor, calls him a polite man.
*   He argues that if Mr. Nath had a lot of money from crime, he would eat better food.
*   He feels that Mr. Nath is simply lonely and has no friends.

### The Argument

The siblings have a big argument over their differing opinions. Maya is frustrated that Nishad is not cooperating with her investigation and is defending their "criminal" neighbour. Nishad, on the other hand, is upset with Maya for being so judgmental. He feels sorry for Mr. Nath and even wants to befriend him. The story ends with Nishad declaring that he likes Mr. Nath and is going to try to be his friend, leaving Maya annoyed. The mystery of Mr. Nath remains unsolved.

## Themes

*   **Perception vs. Reality:** The story highlights how two people can look at the same situation and come to completely different conclusions. Maya sees a villain, while Nishad sees a lonely, sad man.
*   **Curiosity and Imagination:** It showcases the active and imaginative minds of children and their natural curiosity about the world around them.
*   **Prejudice and Empathy:** The story contrasts Maya's prejudiced view, based on appearances and assumptions, with Nishad's empathetic and kind-hearted approach. It teaches us not to judge a book by its cover.
