## Character Sketch

There are two main characters in the story:

1.  **The Narrator (The Author):** He is the owner of the bicycle. He is initially proud of his bike and plans a long ride. However, he is too polite or weak-willed to stop his friend from dismantling his beloved bicycle. He watches in helpless frustration as his bike is taken to pieces.

2.  **The Friend:** He is an overconfident and clumsy man. He presents himself as a bicycle expert but is completely incompetent. He has a destructive urge to "fix" things that are not broken. His actions, from shaking the front wheel to taking apart the gear-case, are disastrous and create more problems than they solve. He is cheerful and confident throughout the mess he creates.

## Detailed Plot Summary

The story unfolds in a series of comical events:

### 1. The Proposal for a Ride
The author and his friend decide to go for a long bicycle ride the next day. The author is pleased with his bicycle and the plan.

### 2. The "Inspection" Begins
Before the ride, the friend offers to check the bicycle. He starts by violently shaking the front wheel. The author tells him not to, as it's not good for the bicycle, but the friend insists the bearings are all wrong.

### 3. Dismantling the Front Wheel
The friend unscrews the front wheel. Suddenly, about a dozen small steel balls (ball bearings) roll all over the path. The friend seems pleased and says they must find them all, or the machine will be unsafe. They spend a long time crawling on the ground and manage to find only sixteen.

### 4. Attacking the Gear-Case
Next, the friend decides to check the gear-case. The author tries to stop him, telling him that a friend who is an expert advised him never to meddle with the gear-case. But the friend dismisses this, claiming that nothing is easier than taking off a gear-case. He takes it apart, and soon they are surrounded by screws and parts on the gravel path.

### 5. The Chain Problem
After putting the gear-case back, the friend moves on to the chain.
*   First, he tightens it so much that the back wheel cannot move at all.
*   Then, he loosens it until it is twice as loose as it was before.

### 6. The Final Mess
By now, the bicycle is in complete chaos. The friend, tired and annoyed, gives up. He says, "I think that will do," and props the dismantled parts against the wall. He leaves the author to clean up the mess.

### 7. The "Fight" to Reassemble
The author describes his struggle to put the bicycle back together as a "fight."
*   He gets covered in oil and dirt.
*   The bicycle seems to have a will of its own, hitting him and getting stuck in awkward positions.
*   At one point, he is on the gravel path with the bicycle on top of him.

### 8. The End
Finally, after a lot of struggle, the author manages to reassemble the bicycle, although it is wobbly and in poor condition. The friend comes back, pats him on the back, and cheerfully says, "Well, you are a wonder!" He suggests they should now start for their ride. The author, exhausted and dirty, has had enough and sends his friend home.

## Themes

*   **False Expertise:** The story makes fun of people who pretend to be experts but are actually incompetent. The friend's confidence is completely misplaced.
*   **Humor in Everyday Situations:** The author finds humor in a frustrating situation, turning a disastrous bicycle repair into a funny and memorable story.
*   **The Folly of Unsolicited Help:** It shows how unwanted and unskilled help can be more damaging than helpful. The narrator would have been better off if his friend had never offered to "help."

## Important Questions and Answers

**Q1: Did the front wheel really wobble? What is your opinion? Give a reason for your answer.**
**A1:** No, the front wheel did not really wobble. The author mentions that his friend asked, "Doesn't it wobble?" and the author replied, "It doesn't if you don't wobble it." This suggests the bicycle was in good condition, and the friend was just looking for an excuse to meddle with it.

**Q2: In what condition did the author find the bicycle when he returned from the tool shed?**
**A2:** When the author returned from the tool shed, he found his friend sitting on the ground with the front wheel between his legs. He was playing with it, and the rest of the bicycle was lying on the gravel path beside him.

**Q3: “Nothing is easier than taking off the gear-case.” Comment on or continue this sentence in the light of what actually happens.**
**A3:** The friend's statement, "Nothing is easier than taking off the gear-case," is highly ironic. While he found it easy to take it off, he had no idea how to put it back together. His attempt to fix it resulted in losing screws and leaving the bicycle in a complete mess, proving that taking something apart is much easier than reassembling it correctly.

**Q4: Describe the 'fight' between the man and the machine. Find the relevant sentences in the text and write them.**
**A4:** The 'fight' was the author's struggle to put his dismantled bicycle back together. He describes it humorously as a battle.
*   "Then he lost his temper and tried bullying the thing. The bicycle, I was glad to see, showed spirit."
*   "Then I got nasty. I took him by the scruff of the neck and the fork and shook him."
*   "One moment I would be on the gravel path, and he on top of me; the next, the position would be reversed—he on the gravel path, I on him."
*   At the end, he was "dishevelled, bleeding, and dirty," but he had managed to fix the bicycle.
