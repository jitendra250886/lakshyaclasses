## Characters

*   **The Narrator:** A long-time customer of Mr. Gessler since his childhood. He admires Mr. Gessler's skill and dedication. He feels a sense of sympathy and respect for the old shoemaker.

## Story Explanation

### The Gessler Brothers' Shop

The story begins with the narrator describing the shoe shop of the Gessler brothers. It was a simple shop in a fashionable part of London, with their name "Gessler Brothers" written on a sign. They did not advertise; their reputation was built solely on the exceptional quality of the boots they made.

The narrator remembers Mr. Gessler from his youth. Mr. Gessler would personally attend to customers. He would measure their feet with great care and make boots that fit perfectly and lasted for a very long time. For him, making boots was a sacred art.

### The Narrator's Complaint and Mr. Gessler's Reaction

One day, the narrator goes to Mr. Gessler's shop wearing a pair of boots he had bought from a large firm in an emergency. He mentions to Mr. Gessler that the boots are creaking. Mr. Gessler looks at the boots with a sad and critical eye and presses a spot with his finger. He tells the narrator that he shouldn't have expected them to be good as they were not made by him.

He then speaks with bitterness about the big firms that get business through advertising, not by producing quality work. He explains how these big companies take business away from craftsmen like him, who spend a lot of time and effort on each pair. This encounter makes the narrator feel guilty, and he ends up ordering several pairs of boots.

### The Decline of the Business

Years pass, and each time the narrator visits the shop, he notices that Mr. Gessler has grown older and more worn out. On one visit, he learns that Mr. Gessler's elder brother has died. The business is clearly struggling. Mr. Gessler complains that people prefer cheap, mass-produced shoes and do not appreciate the value of handcrafted quality anymore. The shop, which once occupied two storefronts, is now reduced to just one.

### The Final Encounter and Mr. Gessler's Death

The narrator returns to London after several years and goes to see Mr. Gessler. The shoemaker is now very old, over seventy-five, and looks frail. He fails to recognize the narrator at first. The narrator, feeling sorry for him, orders several pairs of boots.

The boots arrive and are better than everâ€”perfect in fit and quality. A week later, the narrator goes to the shop to personally thank Mr. Gessler. However, he is surprised to see a young Englishman in the shop. The young man informs him that Mr. Gessler has died.

He explains that Mr. Gessler died of "slow starvation." The old man worked day and night, never giving himself time to eat. All the money he earned went into paying the rent for the shop and buying the best quality leather. He lost all his customers because he took too long to make the boots. The new owner concludes by saying, "But he made good boots."

## Themes of the Story

*   **Commitment and Dedication:** The story is a tribute to true craftsmanship. Mr. Gessler was completely devoted to his work, treating it as an art form.
*   **Quality over Quantity:** Mr. Gessler never compromised on the quality of his materials or his work, even when it led to financial ruin.
*   **The Struggle of Small Artisans:** The story highlights the harsh reality faced by small, independent craftsmen in the age of industrialization and big business. Big companies use advertising and mass production to drive small, quality-focused businesses to closure.
*   **The Price of Perfection:** Mr. Gessler's relentless pursuit of perfection led to his isolation and ultimately his tragic death from starvation. He sacrificed his life for his art.
