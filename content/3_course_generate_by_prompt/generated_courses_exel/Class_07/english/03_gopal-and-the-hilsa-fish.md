## Character Sketches

*   **The King:** He is the ruler of the kingdom. Initially, he is short-tempered and gets easily annoyed by the constant talk of Hilsa fish. However, he is also fair and appreciates true wisdom, as shown when he congratulates Gopal.
*   **Gopal:** He is the wisest courtier in the king's court. He is known for his intelligence, wit, and presence of mind. He is a clever man who can find a solution to any problem by thinking differently.
*   **The Courtiers:** They are the other members of the king's court. They are often jealous of Gopal's wisdom and try to undermine him, but they fail.

## Detailed Story Explanation

The story unfolds in a series of scenes, typical of a comic strip.

### Scene 1: The Hilsa Season Frenzy

It was the season for Hilsa fish, and it was the only topic of conversation everywhere.
*   **Fishermen:** They were catching and selling only Hilsa.
*   **Householders:** People in the market were bargaining for Hilsa, saying, "Come, buy! The price of Hilsa is down today!"
*   **The Royal Court:** Even the king's courtiers could not stop talking about the huge Hilsa they had seen.

The king became extremely angry and frustrated with this constant chatter. He scolded his courtiers, warning them to stop talking about it.

### Scene 2: The King's Challenge

Feeling guilty, one of the courtiers fell silent. The king, however, felt a bit bad for losing his temper. To prove a point, he challenged his wisest courtier, Gopal.

**The Challenge:** The king asked Gopal to buy a huge Hilsa fish and bring it to the palace. The condition was that **no one** should ask him a single word about the fish on his way from the market to the palace.

Gopal calmly accepted the challenge, saying, "I accept the challenge, Your Majesty."

### Scene 3: Gopal's Strange Preparation

A few days later, Gopal began his preparation to fulfill the challenge. He did some very strange things:
1.  **Half-shaved his face:** He shaved off the beard from only one side of his face.
2.  **Smeared ash:** He covered his body with ash.
3.  **Wore rags:** He dressed himself in torn and dirty clothes (rags).

His wife was shocked and asked him what was wrong. She thought he had gone mad and pleaded with him not to go out in such a disgraceful state. But Gopal simply told her that he was going out to buy a huge Hilsa fish.

### Scene 4: The Journey from the Market

Gopal bought a big Hilsa fish and started walking towards the palace. As he walked through the streets, everyone's attention was on his ridiculous appearance, not on the fish he was carrying.
*   A child pointed at him, saying, "Mother, look at that man! Isn't he comical?"
*   People called him a "madman."
*   Some thought he was a "mystic" (a holy man).

Throughout his journey, people laughed, stared, and commented on him, but **not a single person asked him about the Hilsa fish**.

### Scene 5: At the Palace

When Gopal reached the palace gates, the guards stopped him. They refused to let him in, saying, "You can't see the king. Get away with you!"

Gopal did not argue. Instead, he began to sing and dance loudly right in front of the palace gate. The king heard the noise from inside and ordered his guards to bring the man to him at once.

### Scene 6: Gopal Wins the Challenge

The guards brought Gopal before the king. The courtiers immediately recognized him. The king was angry and confused. He asked Gopal, "Why are you dressed up in this ridiculous fashion?"

This was the moment Gopal was waiting for. He calmly replied, "Your Majesty, you seem to have forgotten something."

The king tried to remember, and suddenly it struck himâ€”the challenge! Gopal explained that from the market to the palace, not a single person had asked him about the Hilsa fish. Everyone was too busy looking at his strange clothes, half-shaven face, and the ash on his body.

The king burst out laughing. He understood how cleverly Gopal had diverted everyone's attention. He congratulated Gopal, saying, "Haha! Well, Gopal, congratulations! You have achieved the impossible once again!"

## Themes of the Story

*   **Wit and Wisdom:** The story highlights the importance of intelligence and thinking creatively to solve problems. Gopal's solution was not about strength but about cleverness.
*   **Presence of Mind:** Gopal uses his presence of mind to handle the situation. He understands human psychology and uses it to his advantage.
*   **Thinking Outside the Box:** Instead of trying to hide the fish or argue with people, Gopal created a bigger spectacle than the fish itself, proving that unconventional solutions are often the most effective.
