The story is about a magical garden located in a school playground. It was called a magic garden because it had fairies. The flowers in the garden, like **sunflowers, roses, marigolds, poppies, and pansies**, loved the little children from the school.

The children were like little gardeners. They took great care of the plants by watering their thirsty roots and digging the soil around them. The birds also loved the children because they would bring bread for them. The flowers would talk to each other, expressing how much they loved the children.

One sunny morning, the flowers were talking to the birds. They asked the birds to sing for the children who would be arriving soon. Suddenly, the children came out laughing and singing, and the flowers stopped their songs to listen to them.

Their songs could only be heard by the children. The fairies made beautiful dresses for the flowers using sunshine and wings.
