### Explanation of the Poem (कविता का सार)

The poem begins by introducing Samar Singh, who was very fat and always boasting about his size. He would often tease a small and thin girl named Chhoti.

**Samar Singh's Pride (समर सिंह का घमंड)**
Samar Singh was very proud of being fat. He would tell Chhoti that he was bigger and stronger than her. He bragged about eating lots of food like big rotis and parathas, while Chhoti was small and ate only one small roti.

**The Seesaw Game (सी-सॉ का खेल)**
One day, Chhoti got tired of his teasing and cleverly suggested they play on the seesaw. Samar Singh agreed, thinking he would easily win.

**Chhoti's Trick (छोटी का कमाल)**
When they both sat on the seesaw, something funny happened.
*   Samar Singh, being heavy, sat on one end, and it went straight down.
*   Chhoti sat on the other end, and because she was light, her side flew high up into the air!

Samar Singh was stuck on the ground, and Chhoti was up in the sky. This sudden turn of events shocked Samar Singh, and his pride was shattered. He realized that being fat didn't make him superior. Chhoti, despite being small, had outsmarted him. This is the "kamaal" or wonder of Chhoti.
