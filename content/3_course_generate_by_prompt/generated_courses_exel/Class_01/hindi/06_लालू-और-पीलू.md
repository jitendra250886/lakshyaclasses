## Story Explanation (कहानी का सार)

Once, there was a hen who had two chicks, Lalu and Peelu.

Lalu was fond of red things. He would only eat things that were red in colour. Peelu was fond of yellow things and would only eat things that were yellow.

One day, Lalu saw something red on a plant. Without thinking, he ate it. It was a red chili!

Immediately, Lalu's mouth started to burn. He started crying out in pain. The mother hen came running to him.

Peelu also ran to help his brother. He quickly brought a piece of yellow jaggery (गुड़). Lalu gobbled up the jaggery. The sweetness of the jaggery soothed the burning in his mouth, and he felt much better.

The mother hen was very happy. She hugged and kissed both Lalu and Peelu lovingly.
