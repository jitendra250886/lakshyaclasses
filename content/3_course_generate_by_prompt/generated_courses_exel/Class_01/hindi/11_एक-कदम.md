# Chapter 11: एक कदम (Ek Kadam - One Step)

## Introduction

Welcome to the exciting world of numbers! The chapter "एक कदम" (Ek Kadam), which means "One Step," is a fun and interactive lesson that teaches us how to count from 1 to 9. Just like we take one step at a time to walk, we will learn numbers one by one. This chapter uses pictures of a boy, a frog, and other objects to make learning how to count, write, and order numbers easy and enjoyable.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Counting from 1 to 9 (एक से नौ तक गिनती)

This chapter focuses on introducing and practicing the numbers from one to nine. Let's learn them together!

| अंक (Ank - Number) | हिंदी में (In Hindi) | In English |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| १ | एक | One |
| २ | दो | Two |
| ३ | तीन | Three |
| ४ | चार | Four |
| ५ | पाँच | Five |
| ६ | छह | Six |
| ७ | सात | Seven |
| ८ | आठ | Eight |
| ९ | नौ | Nine |

### 2. Sequencing (क्रम में लगाना)

Sequencing means putting things in the correct order. In this chapter, we see a boy taking steps and a frog jumping from one lily pad to another. They both follow the order of numbers: 1, then 2, then 3, and so on. This helps us understand that numbers have a specific sequence.

## Chapter Activities Explained

### Activity 1: The Boy's Steps and the Frog's Jumps (लड़के के कदम और मेंढक की छलाँग)

*   **The Boy's Steps:** You will see a picture of a boy taking steps, with each step numbered from 1 to 9. This visually shows the progression of numbers.
*   **The Frog's Jumps:** A frog is shown jumping on lily pads. Each lily pad has a number from 1 to 9. The frog jumps in the correct order, which reinforces the concept of sequencing.

### Activity 2: Connect the Dots (बिंदु मिलाओ)

This is a fun drawing activity! You are given dots numbered from 1 to 9. By drawing a line connecting the dots in the correct order (from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and so on), you will create a picture of a boat (नाव). This activity helps in:
*   Recognizing numbers.
*   Understanding the correct order of numbers.
*   Improving hand-eye coordination.

### Activity 3: Count and Write (गिनो और लिखो)

In this section, you will see groups of different objects like glasses, candles, stones, and leaves. Your task is to:
1.  **Count** the number of objects in each group.
2.  **Write** the correct number in the box provided.

This activity builds your counting skills and helps you practice writing numerals.

### Activity 4: Matching and Coloring (मिलान करो और रंग भरो)

*   **Matching:** You will be asked to draw lines to match groups that have the same number of objects. For example, a group of 3 balls should be matched with a group of 3 bats.
*   **Coloring:** You will be given a number and a group of pictures (like flowers or balloons). You need to color only the number of pictures mentioned. For example, if the number is '4', you should color only four flowers.

### Activity 5: Before and After (पहले और बाद में)

This activity tests your understanding of number order. You will be given a number and asked to write:
*   The number that comes **before** it (पहले).
*   The number that comes **after** it (बाद में).

**Example:**
*   What comes after 5 (पाँच)?  
    Answer: 6 (छह)
*   What comes before 3 (तीन)?  
    Answer: 2 (दो)
