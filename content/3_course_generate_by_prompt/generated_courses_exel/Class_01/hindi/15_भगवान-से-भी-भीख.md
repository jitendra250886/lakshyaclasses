# Chapter 15: भगवान से भी भीख (Bhagwan se bhi Bheekh)

## Story Explanation

This is a simple and meaningful story about a beggar who learns an important lesson about giving.

1.  **The Beggar's Plea:** A beggar was very hungry. He went from door to door but got nothing. Tired, he sat under a tree and prayed to God, asking for food.

2.  **God Appears:** Suddenly, a farmer appeared before him. The farmer looked rich and kind. The beggar thought his prayers were answered and immediately asked the farmer for some food (alms).

3.  **A Surprising Request:** To the beggar's surprise, the farmer held out his own hand and said, "First, give me something from what you have." The beggar was shocked and a little angry. He only had a small bag with a handful of rice grains.

4.  **The Act of Giving:** After some thought, the beggar reluctantly took out just two grains of rice from his bag and gave them to the farmer.

5.  **The Reward:** The farmer smiled and gave the beggar a single, shining golden grain of rice and then disappeared.

6.  **The Regret:** The beggar was happy to see the golden grain. But when he went home and emptied his bag, he found two more golden grains of rice inside. He realized that the farmer was God in disguise. He started crying and regretted his decision. He thought, "If only I had given all my rice grains to him, all of them would have turned into gold!"

## Moral of the Story

The story teaches us the importance of generosity and giving. The key lesson is: **"The more you give, the more you receive."** We should not be selfish and should always be willing to help others. True happiness comes from giving, not just from receiving.
