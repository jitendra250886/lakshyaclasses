## Part 2: The Tailor and his Friend (Story)

### Story Summary

Once there was a tailor named Kalu who had a shop near a river. He had a friend, an elephant named Appu. Every day, Appu would visit Kalu's shop on his way to the river, and Kalu would give him nice things to eat.

One day, Kalu was not in a good mood and decided to play a trick. Instead of giving Appu food, he pricked Appu's trunk with his needle. Appu felt the pain and ran away.

Appu was angry. He went to the river and filled his trunk with muddy water. He came back to Kalu's shop and sprayed the water everywhere. All the new clothes in Kalu's shop became wet and dirty.

Kalu realised his mistake. He understood that he should not have hurt his friend. From that day on, Kalu and Appu became good friends again.

### Moral of the Story

The story teaches us that we should always be kind to our friends and never hurt them. As you treat others, so they will treat you.
