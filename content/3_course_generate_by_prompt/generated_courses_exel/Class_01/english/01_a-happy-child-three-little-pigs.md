## Part 2: The Three Little Pigs (Story)

This is a classic story that teaches us the value of hard work and being wise.

### Story Summary

Once upon a time, there were three little pigs named Sonu, Monu, and Gonu.

*   **Sonu** built his house out of **straw**. It was not very strong.
*   **Monu** built his house out of **sticks**. It was a little stronger than the straw house, but still not very strong.
*   **Gonu** worked hard and built his house out of **bricks**. It was very strong.

One day, a big bad wolf came.

1.  He went to Sonu's house and said, "I will huff and I will puff and I will blow your house down!" He blew the straw house down easily. Sonu ran to Monu's house.
2.  The wolf then went to Monu's house. He huffed and puffed and blew the stick house down. Sonu and Monu ran to Gonu's house.
3.  The wolf came to Gonu's brick house. He huffed and puffed, but he could not blow the strong brick house down.

The wolf was clever and tried to enter the house through the chimney. But Gonu had placed a big pot of hot water under the chimney. The wolf fell right into it and ran away, never to be seen again. Sonu, Monu, and Gonu lived happily together in the strong brick house.
