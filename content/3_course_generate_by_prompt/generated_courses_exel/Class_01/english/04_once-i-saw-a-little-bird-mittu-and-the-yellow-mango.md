## Part 1: Once I Saw A Little Bird (Poem)

### The Poem

> Once I saw a little bird
> Come hop, hop, hop;
> I cried, “Little bird,
> Will you stop, stop, stop?”
>
> I was going to the window
> To say, “How do you do?”
> But he shook his little tail,
> And away he flew.

### Explanation of the Poem
