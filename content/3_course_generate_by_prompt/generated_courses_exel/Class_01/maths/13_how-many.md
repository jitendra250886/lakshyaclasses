# Chapter 13: How Many

## Introduction to Counting

Hello, little mathematicians! This chapter is a fun game of finding and counting. We will look at different pictures, count the things we see in them, and write down the number. It's all about answering the question: "How many?"

## Counting Objects and Writing Numbers

The main skill in this chapter is to look at a group of items, count them one by one, and then write the correct number.

**How to do it:**
1.  **Look Carefully:** Look at the picture and see what you need to count. It could be balloons, flowers, animals, or anything else!
2.  **Point and Count:** Point to each object with your finger and count aloud. This helps you not to miss any or count the same one twice.
3.  **Write the Number:** Once you have counted all the objects, write the final number in the space or box given.

### Example 1: Counting Balloons

Imagine you see a picture with many colourful balloons.



Let's count them together: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
There are **7** balloons!

### Example 2: Counting Flowers

Now, let's look at a bunch of flowers.



Let's count them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
There are **5** flowers altogether.

## Practice Counting

Let's practice with a few more examples. Look at the object, count how many there are, and write the number.

| Object | Picture (Description) | How Many? |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| Books | A stack of four books | 4 |
| Candles | Nine candles burning brightly | 9 |
| Rats | Three small rats | 3 |
| Bells | Four hanging bells | 4 |
| Brushes | A set of seven paint brushes | 7 |

## Counting in a Big Picture

Sometimes, you will see a big picture with many different things happening. Your job is to find and count specific items within that busy picture.

For example, in a picture of a wedding party, you might be asked:
-   How many people are there?
-   How many flowers can you find?
-   How many musical instruments are being played?

**Tip:** When counting in a busy picture, be very careful. Count slowly and double-check your answer to make sure you haven't missed anything.

## What Does "Altogether" Mean?

You will sometimes see the word **altogether**. It's a simple way of asking for the total number of things when you combine two or more groups.

### Example:

-   A girl has **3** flowers.
-   A boy has **2** flowers.
-   How many flowers do they have **altogether**?

To find the answer, you just count all the flowers together:
1, 2, 3 (from the girl) + 4, 5 (from the boy) = **5** flowers altogether.

This is your first step towards learning addition!

## Summary

In this chapter, we learned the important skill of counting.
-   We practiced counting different objects in pictures.
-   We learned to write the correct number after counting.
-   We understood that "altogether" means counting the total number of items from different groups combined.
-   The best way to get good at counting is to practice with things you see around you every day
