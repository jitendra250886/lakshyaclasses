# Chapter 8: Numbers From Twenty One To Fifty

## Introduction to Numbers Beyond Twenty

In the last chapter, we learned numbers up to twenty. Now, let's learn the numbers that come after twenty, all the way up to fifty!

A simple way to understand these bigger numbers is by using bundles of sticks.

*   **One bundle** has **10** sticks. We call this **1 Ten**.
*   **Two bundles** have **20** sticks. We call this **2 Tens**.

When we add loose sticks (Ones) to these bundles, we get new numbers.

## Numbers from 21 to 30

To make numbers from 21 to 30, we start with **2 bundles of 10 (2 Tens)** and add loose sticks (Ones).

*   2 Tens and 1 One = 21 (Twenty-one)
*   2 Tens and 2 Ones = 22 (Twenty-two)

| Number | Tens and Ones | Number Name |
| :----: | :------------------: | :---------- |
|   21   |   2 Tens and 1 One   | Twenty-one  |
|   22   |   2 Tens and 2 Ones  | Twenty-two  |
|   23   |   2 Tens and 3 Ones  | Twenty-three|
|   24   |   2 Tens and 4 Ones  | Twenty-four |
|   25   |   2 Tens and 5 Ones  | Twenty-five |
|   26   |   2 Tens and 6 Ones  | Twenty-six  |
|   27   |   2 Tens and 7 Ones  | Twenty-seven|
|   28   |   2 Tens and 8 Ones  | Twenty-eight|
|   29   |   2 Tens and 9 Ones  | Twenty-nine |
|   30   |       3 Tens       | Thirty      |

## Numbers from 31 to 40

Now, let's use **3 bundles of 10 (3 Tens)** and add loose sticks.

*   3 Tens and 1 One = 31 (Thirty-one)
*   3 Tens and 2 Ones = 32 (Thirty-two)

| Number | Tens and Ones | Number Name |
| :----: | :------------------: | :----------- |
|   31   |   3 Tens and 1 One   | Thirty-one   |
|   32   |   3 Tens and 2 Ones  | Thirty-two   |
|   33   |   3 Tens and 3 Ones  | Thirty-three |
|   34   |   3 Tens and 4 Ones  | Thirty-four  |
|   35   |   3 Tens and 5 Ones  | Thirty-five  |
|   36   |   3 Tens and 6 Ones  | Thirty-six   |
|   37   |   3 Tens and 7 Ones  | Thirty-seven |
|   38   |   3 Tens and 8 Ones  | Thirty-eight |
|   39   |   3 Tens and 9 Ones  | Thirty-nine  |
|   40   |       4 Tens       | Forty        |

## Numbers from 41 to 50

To make numbers from 41 to 50, we use **4 bundles of 10 (4 Tens)** and add loose sticks.

*   4 Tens and 1 One = 41 (Forty-one)
*   4 Tens and 2 Ones = 42 (Forty-two)

| Number | Tens and Ones | Number Name |
| :----: | :------------------: | :---------- |
|   41   |   4 Tens and 1 One   | Forty-one   |
|   42   |   4 Tens and 2 Ones  | Forty-two   |
|   43   |   4 Tens and 3 Ones  | Forty-three |
|   44   |   4 Tens and 4 Ones  | Forty-four  |
|   45   |   4 Tens and 5 Ones  | Forty-five  |
|   46   |   4 Tens and 6 Ones  | Forty-six   |
|   47   |   4 Tens and 7 Ones  | Forty-seven |
|   48   |   4 Tens and 8 Ones  | Forty-eight |
|   49   |   4 Tens and 9 Ones  | Forty-nine  |
|   50   |       5 Tens       | Fifty       |

## Summary

In this chapter, we learned to count, write, and understand numbers from twenty-one (21) to fifty (50). We used the concept of 'Tens' (bundles of 10) and 'Ones' (loose items) to see how these numbers are formed. Keep practicing counting and writing these numbers
