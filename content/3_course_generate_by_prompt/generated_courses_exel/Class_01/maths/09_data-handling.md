# 9. Data Handling

## What is Data Handling?

Data handling is a simple way of collecting, sorting, and counting information to understand it better. Think of it like organizing your toys! You put all the cars in one box, all the blocks in another, and then you can easily count how many of each you have.

In this chapter, we will learn to:
*   Count different objects in a group.
*   Write down the numbers in a table.
*   Answer questions based on our counting.

### Example 1: Counting Shapes

Look at the picture below. It has many different shapes. Let's sort and count them!



**Step 1: Count each shape.**
*   Let's count the Triangles (▲). There are **7** triangles.
*   Let's count the Circles (●). There are **5** circles.
*   Let's count the Squares (■). There are **3** squares.
*   Let's count the Rectangles (▬). There are **4** rectangles.

**Step 2: Put the information in a table.**

| Shape | How Many? |
| :--- | :---: |
| Triangle (▲) | 7 |
| Circle (●) | 5 |
| Square (■) | 3 |
| Rectangle (▬) | 4 |

**Step 3: Answer questions based on the table.**
*   **Question:** Which shape is the most in number?
    *   **Answer:** The Triangle (▲) is the most, with 7.
*   **Question:** Which shape is the least in number?
    *   **Answer:** The Square (■) is the least, with 3.
*   **Question:** How many circles and squares are there altogether?
    *   **Answer:** 5 circles + 3 squares = 8 shapes.

*   Oranges (🍊): There are **5** oranges.

**Step 2: Put the information in a table.**

| Fruit | How Many? |
| :--- | :---: |
| Apple (🍎) | 6 |
| Banana (🍌) | 4 |
| Orange (🍊) | 5 |

**Step 3: Answer questions based on the table.**
*   **Question:** How many apples are there in the basket?
    *   **Answer:** There are **6** apples.
*   **Question:** Which fruit is the least in number?
    *   **Answer:** The Banana (🍌) is the least, with 4.

### Example 3: Counting Letters in Names

We can also count the number of letters in our friends' names.

Let's take a few names:
*   R A M
*   S I T A
*   A R J U N
*   S A L M A N

**Step 1: Count the letters in each name.**
*   RAM -> 3 letters
*   SITA -> 4 letters
*   ARJUN -> 5 letters
*   SALMAN -> 6 letters

**Step 2: Put the information in a table.**

| Name | Number of Letters |
| :--- | :---: |
| RAM | 3 |
| SITA | 4 |
| ARJUN | 5 |
| SALMAN | 6 |

**Step 3: Answer questions based on the table.**
*   **Question:** How many names have 4 letters?
    *   **Answer:** 1 name (SITA).
*   **Question:** Which name is the longest?
    *   **Answer:** SALMAN.

## Summary

Data Handling is the process of gathering information, organizing it (usually by counting and putting it in a table), and then using that organized information to answer questions. It helps us see things like "which is the most," "which is the least," or "how many there are in total" very easily.
