# Chapter 5: Numbers From Ten To Twenty

## 1. Making a Group of 10

To understand numbers bigger than 9, we first learn to make a group of 10. Think of it as making a **bundle** or a **team**. When we have 10 single items, we can group them together to make **one group of ten**.

*   **Example with Sticks:**
    *   Imagine you have many single matchsticks.
    *   Count 10 matchsticks.
    *   Tie them together with a rubber band.
    *   This is now **one bundle of 10**.



This idea of making a group of 10 helps us count bigger numbers easily.

## 2. Understanding Tens and Ones

After 9, we start using two places for numbers: the **Tens** place and the **Ones** place.

*   **Ones:** These are the single, extra items.
*   **Tens:** This shows how many groups of 10 we have.

Let's look at the number **13**.
*   It has **one bundle of 10** sticks.
*   And **3 single** sticks left over.
*   So, 13 is **1 Ten** and **3 Ones**.



## 3. Counting from 10 to 20

Let's see how all the numbers from 10 to 20 are made of Tens and Ones.

| Numeral | Number Name | Composition |
| :------ | :---------- | :-------------------------------- |
| 10      | Ten         | 1 Ten + 0 Ones (One bundle of 10) |
| 11      | Eleven      | 1 Ten + 1 One                     |
| 12      | Twelve      | 1 Ten + 2 Ones                    |
| 13      | Thirteen    | 1 Ten + 3 Ones                    |
| 14      | Fourteen    | 1 Ten + 4 Ones                    |
| 15      | Fifteen     | 1 Ten + 5 Ones                    |
| 16      | Sixteen     | 1 Ten + 6 Ones                    |
| 17      | Seventeen   | 1 Ten + 7 Ones                    |
| 18      | Eighteen    | 1 Ten + 8 Ones                    |
| 19      | Nineteen    | 1 Ten + 9 Ones                    |
| 20      | Twenty      | 2 Tens + 0 Ones (Two bundles of 10) |

## 4. Practice Activities

Let's practice what we have learned.

### A. Fill in the Missing Numbers
Count forward and write the number that comes next.
*   12, 13, **14**, 15
*   17, **18**, 19, 20

### B. Circle the Bigger Number
Look at the two numbers and circle the one that is greater.
*   11 and **13**
*   **18** and 8
*   **17** and 12

### C. Circle the Smaller Number
Look at the two numbers and circle the one that is smaller.
*   **15** and 19
*   7 and **6**
*   **10** and 20

## 5. Simple Addition and Subtraction

We can also do simple addition and subtraction with these numbers.

### Addition (Putting Together)
**Question:** Rahul has 8 pencils. His friend gives him 5 more. How many pencils does Rahul have in total?

*   **Answer:** Start at 8 and count 5 steps forward.
    *   8... 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
*   So, 8 + 5 = **13** pencils.

### Subtraction (Taking Away)
**Question:** Sita had 15 balloons. 4 balloons flew away. How many are left?

*   **Answer:** We can cross out 4 from 15.
    *   Or, count backward 4 steps from 15.
    *   15... 14, 13, 12, 11
*   So, 15 - 4 = **11** balloons.

## Summary

In this chapter, we learned to count and understand numbers from 10 to 20. The most important idea is making a **group of 10**. Every number from 10 to 19 is made of **one group of ten** and some extra **ones**. The number 20 is made of **two groups of ten**. We also practiced comparing numbers and doing simple addition and subtraction within this range.
