# Chapter 6: Time

Hello students! Today, we are going to learn about a very interesting topic: **Time**. Time helps us understand when things happen. Let's explore the different parts of the day and learn how to put our activities in order!

## Parts of the Day

Our day is divided into different parts. Each part has its own special activities.

### 1. Morning ‚òÄÔ∏è
The morning is when the sun rises and a new day begins!
*   We **wake up**.
*   We **brush our teeth**.
*   We take a **bath**.
*   We eat our **breakfast**.
*   We go to **school**.

### 2. Afternoon üå§Ô∏è
The afternoon is the middle part of the day when the sun is high in the sky.
*   We eat our **lunch**.
*   We study in school.
*   We come back **home from school**.

### 3. Evening üåá
The evening is when the sun starts to set and it gets a little darker.
*   We **play** with our friends.
*   We do our **homework**.
*   We spend time with our family.

### 4. Night üåô
The night is when the moon and stars come out, and it is dark outside.
*   We eat our **dinner**.
*   We listen to bedtime stories.
*   We go to **sleep**.

## Sequencing Events: What Comes First?

Many things we do happen in a specific order, or **sequence**. Let's look at an example of making a chapati.

1.  **First**, we take flour in a pot.
2.  **Next**, we add water and make the dough.
3.  **Then**, we make a small ball and roll it out to make a chapati.
4.  **Finally**, we cook it on the fire.

Putting things in the correct order helps us understand how they work!

## Earlier and Later

We use the words **earlier** and **later** to compare when two things happen.

*   **Earlier:** Something that happens first.
*   **Later:** Something that happens after.

**Examples:**
*   Eating breakfast happens **earlier** than eating lunch.
*   Going to school happens **earlier** than playing in the evening.
*   Coming home from school happens **later** than eating breakfast.

## How Long Does It Take?

Some activities take more time than others. We can say they take a **longer** time or a **shorter** time.

Let's compare some activities!

| Takes a Longer Time | Takes a Shorter Time |
| :------------------ | :------------------- |
| Filling a bucket    | Filling a glass      |
| Walking to a shop   | Running to a shop    |
| Reading a storybook | Saying the alphabet  |
| Eating a full meal  | Eating a biscuit     |

Think about your day. What activities take a long time? What activities take a short time?

## Summary

*   Time helps us know when to do our daily activities.
*   A day is divided into **morning, afternoon, evening, and night**.
*   Activities happen in a specific order, which is called a **sequence**.
*   We use words like **earlier** and **later** to talk about the order of events.
*   Some tasks take a **longer** time to finish, while others take a **shorter** time.
