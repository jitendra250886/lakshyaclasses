# Chapter 7: Measurement

Hello, little champs! Welcome to the exciting world of measurement. Measurement is all about comparing things. Is something big or small? Tall or short? Heavy or light? Let's find out together!

## Comparing Sizes and Lengths

We can compare objects based on their length, height, and thickness.

### Longer and Shorter 📏

When we compare how long things are from one end to another, we use the words **longer** and **shorter**.

*   Imagine you have two pencils. One is a new, long pencil, and the other is a small one you have used a lot.
    *   The new pencil is **longer**.
    *   The used pencil is **shorter**.



**Examples:**
*   A train is **longer** than a car.
*   A ruler is **longer** than an eraser.

> **Think and Tell:** Look at your crayon and your paintbrush. Which one is **longer**?

### Taller and Shorter 🦒

When we compare how high things are from top to bottom, we use the words **taller** and **shorter**. We usually use these for things that stand up.

*   Look at a tall giraffe and a small cat.
    *   The giraffe is **taller**.
    *   The cat is **shorter**.



**Examples:**
*   Your father is **taller** than you.
*   A building is **taller** than a house.

> **Activity Time:** Stand next to your friend. Who is **taller** and who is **shorter**?

### Thicker and Thinner 📚

When we compare how wide or fat things are, we use the words **thicker** and **thinner**.

*   Think about your Maths book and a single page from it.
    *   The book is **thicker**.
    *   The single page is **thinner**.



**Examples:**
*   A tree trunk is **thicker** than a small branch.
*   A thick rope is **thicker** than a thin thread.

> **Think and Tell:** Look at your mother's hair tie and a rubber band. Which one is **thicker**?

## Comparing Weights

### Heavier and Lighter ⚖️

When we lift two things, one can feel heavy and the other can feel light. We use the words **heavier** and **lighter** to compare their weight.

*   Imagine holding a big pumpkin in one hand and a small lemon in the other.
    *   The pumpkin is **heavier**. It's hard to lift!
    *   The lemon is **lighter**. It's easy to lift!



**Examples:**
*   An elephant is **heavier** than an ant.
*   A school bag full of books is **heavier** than an empty lunch box.

> **Activity Time:** Hold your school bag in one hand and your water bottle in the other. Which one feels **heavier**?

## How Do We Measure? (Using Body Parts)

In olden days, and even now for fun, people used their body parts to measure things. These are called non-standard units because everyone's body parts are of different sizes!

| Unit | Description | How to Measure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Handspan** 🖐️ | The distance from the tip of your thumb to the tip of your little finger when your hand is stretched out. | You can measure the length of your study table using your handspan. |
| **Footspan** 👣 | The distance from the tip of your big toe to your heel. | You can measure the length of your room by walking heel-to-toe. |
| **Cubit** 💪 | The distance from your elbow to the tip of your middle finger. | You can measure the length of a bed or a mat using your cubit. |

> **Let's Measure!** Try to measure the length of your bed using your **handspan**. How many handspans long is it? Now ask your parent to do the same. Is the number the same?

## Summary

*   We use words like **Longer/Shorter** and **Taller/Shorter** to compare length and height.
*   We use **Thicker/Thinner** to compare the width of objects.
*   We use **Heavier/Lighter** to compare the weight of objects.
*   We can measure things using non-standard units like **Handspan**, **Footspan**, and **Cubit**.
