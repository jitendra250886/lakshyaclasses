# Chapter 1: Shapes and Space

Hello, little explorers! Welcome to the wonderful world of Maths. Today, we will learn about different shapes and how to describe where things are. Look around you! Everything has a shape and a place. Let's get started!

***

## Inside and Outside

Some things are **inside** a container, and some things are **outside**.

- **Inside**: When something is enclosed or within the boundaries of another object.
- **Outside**: When something is not enclosed or is external to an object.

**Example:**
Imagine a basket full of apples.
- The apples are **inside** the basket.
- A banana lying next to the basket is **outside** the basket.

## Bigger and Smaller

We can compare two things to see which one is big and which one is small.

- **Bigger**: The object that takes up more space.
- **Smaller**: The object that takes up less space.

**Example:**
Look at an elephant and a mouse.
- The elephant is **Bigger**.
- The mouse is **Smaller**.

### Activity: Tick (âœ“) the Smaller one.
- A car and a bus? (Answer: Car)
- A football and a marble? (Answer: Marble)

## Biggest and Smallest

When we have more than two things, we can find the one that is the **biggest** of all and the one that is the **smallest** of all.

**Example:**
Imagine a mango tree, a small rose plant, and a tiny blade of grass.
- The mango tree is the **Biggest**.
- The blade of grass is the **Smallest**.

## Positional Words

Positional words tell us where something is located.

### Top and Bottom
- **Top**: The highest point of something.
- **Bottom**: The lowest point of something.

**Example:**
On a slide in the park:
- The child ready to slide is at the **Top**.
- The child who has finished sliding is at the **Bottom**.

### Nearer and Farther
These words are used to compare the distance of two objects from a certain point.

- **Nearer**: Closer to something.
- **Farther**: More distant from something.

**Example:**
Imagine a house. There is a tree close to it and a well far away.
- The tree is **Nearer** to the house.
- The well is **Farther** from the house.

### Nearest and Farthest
These words are used when comparing more than two objects.

- **Nearest**: The closest one.
- **Farthest**: The most distant one.

**Example:**
Three children are running towards a finish line.
- The child who is about to cross the line is the **Nearest**.
- The child who is at the very back is the **Farthest**.

### On, Under, Above, Below

| Word | Meaning | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **On** | Resting on the surface of something. | The book is **on** the table. |
| **Under** | Directly below something, often covered by it. | The cat is sleeping **under** the table. |
| **Above** | At a higher level, but not directly touching. | The fan is **above** the table. |
| **Below** | At a lower level. | The floor is **below** the table. |

## Shapes Around Us

Everything you see has a shape. Let's learn about some common shapes!

### 2D Shapes (Flat Shapes)

| Shape | Looks Like | Examples from Daily Life |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Circle** |  | Roti, Coin, Wheel, Sun |
| **Square** |  | Handkerchief, Chessboard, Bread slice |
| **Rectangle** |  | Door, Book, Mobile Phone, Chocolate bar |
| **Triangle** |  | Pizza slice, Samosa, Hanger |

### 3D Shapes (Solid Shapes)

These shapes are not flat. You can hold them.

| Shape | Looks Like | Examples from Daily Life |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sphere** |  | Ball, Orange, Globe |
| **Cube** |  | Dice, Ice cube, Sugar cube |
| **Cuboid** |  | Brick, Book, Duster, Lunchbox |
| **Cone** |  | Birthday cap, Ice cream cone |
| **Cylinder** |  | Can, Pipe, Glass, Candle |

## Rolling and Sliding

Some objects can move by rolling, and some can move by sliding.

- **Rolling**: Objects with curved or round surfaces can roll.
  - **Examples**: A ball, a lemon, a pencil.

- **Sliding**: Objects with flat surfaces can slide.
  - **Examples**: A book, a box, a duster.

**Fun Fact:** Some objects can both roll and slide! A coin can slide if you push it flat, but it can roll on its edge. A can of juice can also roll and slide.

## Summary

In this chapter, we learned many new things!
- We learned to describe a thing's position using words like **Inside/Outside**, **Top/Bottom**, and **On/Under**.
- We learned to compare sizes with **Bigger/Smaller** and **Biggest/Smallest**.
- We also compared distances using **Nearer/Farther** and **Nearest/Farthest**.
- We identified common flat shapes (**Circle, Square, Rectangle, Triangle**) and solid shapes (**Sphere, Cube, Cone, Cylinder**) in objects around us.
- Finally, we discovered that round objects **roll** and flat objects **slide**.
