# Chapter 4: Subtraction

## 1. What is Subtraction? (Take Away)

Subtraction is like "taking away". When you have a group of things and you take some of them away, the number of things left is the answer.

Let's understand with a story.
Rohan had **5** balloons.


Suddenly, **2** balloons flew away!


How many balloons are left with Rohan?
Let's count! **1, 2, 3**.
Rohan has **3** balloons left.


So, taking away 2 from 5 leaves 3. This is subtraction!

## 2. The Minus Sign (-)

In maths, we use a special sign for subtraction. It is called the **minus sign** and it looks like this: **-**

We also use the **equals sign** which looks like this: **=**

So, we can write the balloon story in maths like this:

**5 - 2 = 3**

We read this as: "Five **minus** two **equals** three."

## 3. How to Subtract using Pictures

One of the easiest ways to subtract is by using pictures. You just have to cross out the number of things you are taking away.

**Example 1: Subtract 4 - 1**
Here are 4 balls.
⚽️ ⚽️ ⚽️ ⚽️

Let's take away (cross out) 1 ball.
⚽️ ⚽️ ⚽️ ~~⚽️~~

Now, count the balls that are not crossed out. There are **3** balls left.
So, **4 - 1 = 3**

**Example 2: Subtract 6 - 3**
Here are 6 flowers.
🌸 🌸 🌸 🌸 🌸 🌸

Let's take away (cross out) 3 flowers.
🌸 🌸 🌸 ~~🌸~~ ~~🌸~~ ~~🌸~~

Now, count the flowers left. There are **3** flowers left.
So, **6 - 3 = 3**

## 4. How to Subtract using Lines

You can also use lines to subtract quickly.

**Problem: 7 - 4 = ?**

1.  **Draw lines for the bigger number.**
    The bigger number is 7. So, draw 7 lines.
    `| | | | | | |`

2.  **Cross out lines for the smaller number.**
    The smaller number is 4. So, cross out 4 lines.
    `~~|~~ ~~|~~ ~~|~~ ~~|~~ | | |`

3.  **Count the remaining lines.**
    There are **3** lines left.

So, **7 - 4 = 3**

## 5. Vertical Subtraction

We can also write subtraction problems from top to bottom. This is called vertical subtraction.

**Problem: 8 - 5 = ?**

We write it like this:
```
  8
- 5
---
```
To solve this, you can use lines or your fingers.
- Draw 8 lines: `| | | | | | | |`
- Cross out 5 lines: `~~|~~ ~~|~~ ~~|~~ ~~|~~ ~~|~~ | | |`
- Count the remaining lines: **3**

So, the answer is 3.
```
  8
- 5
---
  3
```

## 6. Special Cases in Subtraction

### Subtracting Zero
When you subtract zero (0) from a number, the number does not change. Zero means nothing, so you are taking away nothing!

*   `5 - 0 = 5` (If you have 5 toffees and you eat 0, you still have 5 toffees.)
*   `9 - 0 = 9`

### Subtracting a Number from Itself
When you subtract a number from itself, the answer is always zero (0).

*   `4 - 4 = 0` (If there are 4 frogs on a leaf and all 4 jump into the water, 0 frogs are left on the leaf.)
*   `7 - 7 = 0`

## 7. Word Problems

Let's solve some stories using subtraction.

**Problem 1:**
There were 9 birds on a tree. 5 birds flew away. How many birds are left on the tree?
*   Total birds = 9
*   Birds that flew away = 5
*   **9 - 5 = 4**
*   Answer: **4** birds are left on the tree.

**Problem 2:**
A shopkeeper had 8 eggs. He sold 6 eggs. How many eggs are left?
*   Total eggs = 8
*   Eggs sold = 6
*   **8 - 6 = 2**
*   Answer: **2** eggs are left.

## Summary

*   Subtraction means to "take away" a smaller number from a bigger one.
*   The sign for subtraction is the **minus sign (-)**.
*   You can subtract by crossing out pictures, drawing and crossing out lines, or using your fingers.
*   When you subtract **0** from a number, the number stays the same (e.g., `6 - 0 = 6`).
*   When you subtract a number from **itself**, the answer is always **0** (e.g., `6 - 6 = 0`).
