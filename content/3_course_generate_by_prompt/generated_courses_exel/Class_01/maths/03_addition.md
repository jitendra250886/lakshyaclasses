# Chapter 3: Addition

## 1. What is Addition?

Addition is all about putting things together to find out how many there are in total. When we add, the number of things increases or becomes more.

Think about it like this:
*   You have some toys.
*   Your friend gives you **more** toys.
*   Now, you have **all the toys together**.

We use words like **"more"**, **"altogether"**, **"in all"**, **"total"**, and **"sum"** when we talk about addition.

**Example:**
One little parrot, singing I love you.
One more joins in, making them two!



Here, 1 parrot and 1 more parrot make 2 parrots altogether.

## 2. The Symbols of Addition

In maths, we use special signs or symbols to make our work easier.

### The Plus Sign (+)
This sign tells us to add the numbers. It looks like a small cross. We read it as "plus".

### The Equals Sign (=)
This sign tells us the result or the total. It looks like two small sleeping lines. We read it as "equals" or "is equal to".

So, when we see **2 + 3 = 5**, we read it as "Two plus three equals five."

This means:
*   2 apples and 3 apples are 5 apples altogether.
    üçéüçé + üçéüçéüçé = üçéüçéüçéüçéüçé

## 3. How to Add Numbers

There are many fun ways to add numbers!

### Method 1: Counting Objects
This is the simplest way. Just gather all the objects in one group and count them all.

**Question:** How many balloons are there in all?



*   **Step 1:** Count the balloons in the first group. There are **3**.
*   **Step 2:** Count the balloons in the second group. There are **2**.
*   **Step 3:** Count all the balloons together. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
*   **Answer:** There are **5** balloons in all.

So, **3 + 2 = 5**

### Method 2: Using Your Fingers
You can use your fingers to count and add small numbers.

**Question:** What is 4 + 2?

*   **Step 1:** Open 4 fingers on one hand.
*   **Step 2:** Open 2 more fingers on the other hand.
*   **Step 3:** Count all the open fingers together. You will count 6 fingers.
*   **Answer:** 4 + 2 = 6

### Method 3: Drawing Lines
You can draw lines to represent numbers and then count them.

**Question:** What is 5 + 3?

*   **Step 1:** For the number 5, draw 5 lines: `| | | | |`
*   **Step 2:** For the number 3, draw 3 more lines: `| | |`
*   **Step 3:** Count all the lines together. There are 8 lines.
*   **Answer:** 5 + 3 = 8

## 4. Vertical Addition

Sometimes, we write addition problems from top to bottom. This is called vertical addition. The answer is written below the line.

**Example 1:** Add 2 and 3.

```
  2   (draw ||)
+ 3   (draw |||)
----
  5   (count all lines: |||||)
```

**Example 2:** Add 4 and 1.

```
  4
+ 1
----
  5
```

## 5. Word Problems

Addition helps us solve simple problems in our daily life.

**Problem:** Rahul has 4 pencils. His mother gives him 2 more pencils. How many pencils does Rahul have in all?

*   Pencils Rahul had = 4
*   Pencils his mother gave = 2
*   Total pencils = 4 + 2
*   **Answer:** Rahul has 6 pencils in all.

## Practice Questions

| Horizontal Addition | Vertical Addition |
| :------------------ | :---------------- |
| 3 + 4 = ?           | `5 + 2 = ?`       |
| 6 + 1 = ?           | `3 + 3 = ?`       |
| 7 + 0 = ?           | `8 + 1 = ?`       |
| 5 + 4 = ?           | `0 + 6 = ?`       |

## Summary

*   **Addition** means putting things together to find the total.
*   The **plus sign (+)** tells us to add.
*   The **equals sign (=)** shows the final answer or sum.
*   We can add by counting objects, using our fingers, or drawing lines.
*   Addition helps us find "how many in all" or "the total number".
