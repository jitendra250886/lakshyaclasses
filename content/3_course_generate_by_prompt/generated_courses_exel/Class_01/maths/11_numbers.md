# Chapter 11: Numbers

Hello friends! We have already learned to count numbers up to 50. Now, let's have fun and learn even bigger numbers, all the way up to 100!

## Understanding Tens and Ones

To understand bigger numbers easily, we can think of them in groups of **Tens** and **Ones**.

*   Imagine we have a bundle of 10 pencils. This is **1 Ten**.
*   If we have 3 single pencils, these are **3 Ones**.

So, 1 bundle and 3 single pencils make the number 13 (Thirteen).



We will use this same idea to learn numbers from 51 to 100.

## Numbers from 51 to 70

Let's see how we can make numbers from 51 to 70 using bundles of 10 sticks (Tens) and single sticks (Ones).

| Bundles (Tens) | Single Sticks (Ones) | Number | Number Name |
| :------------: | :------------------: | :----: | :---------- |
|       5        |          1           |   51   | Fifty-one   |
|       5        |          2           |   52   | Fifty-two   |
|       5        |          3           |   53   | Fifty-three |
|       6        |          4           |   64   | Sixty-four  |
|       6        |          5           |   65   | Sixty-five  |
|       7        |          0           |   70   | Seventy     |

### Practice: Fill in the Blanks
- 5 Tens and 6 Ones make **56**.
- 6 Tens and 8 Ones make **68**.
- The number **61** has 6 Tens and 1 One.

## Numbers from 71 to 90

Now let's continue counting with 7, 8, and 9 bundles of ten.

| Bundles (Tens) | Single Sticks (Ones) | Number | Number Name |
| :------------: | :------------------: | :----: | :---------- |
|       7        |          1           |   71   | Seventy-one |
|       7        |          5           |   75   | Seventy-five|
|       8        |          2           |   82   | Eighty-two  |
|       8        |          6           |   86   | Eighty-six  |
|       8        |          9           |   89   | Eighty-nine |
|       9        |          0           |   90   | Ninety      |

## Numbers from 91 to 100

We are almost there! Let's count the last set of numbers up to 100.

When we have 10 bundles of 10, we get a new number: **100 (One Hundred)**!

| Bundles (Tens) | Single Sticks (Ones) | Number | Number Name   |
| :------------: | :------------------: | :----: | :------------ |
|       9        |          1           |   91   | Ninety-one    |
|       9        |          4           |   94   | Ninety-four   |
|       9        |          7           |   97   | Ninety-seven  |
|       9        |          9           |   99   | Ninety-nine   |
|       10       |          0           |  100   | One Hundred   |

## Number Chart (1 to 100)

Here is a chart with all the numbers from 1 to 100. You can use it to practice counting!

## Summary

In this chapter, we learned to count, read, and write numbers from 51 to 100. We used the concept of **Tens** (bundles of 10) and **Ones** (single items) to understand how these numbers are formed. We also looked at the complete number chart from 1 to 100. Keep practicing
