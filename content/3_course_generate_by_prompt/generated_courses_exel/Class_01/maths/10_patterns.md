# Chapter 10: Patterns

## What is a Pattern?

A pattern is something that repeats over and over again. When shapes, objects, numbers, or designs are arranged in a particular order that repeats, it is called a pattern. We can see patterns all around us!

*   The stripes on a zebra.
*   The design on your bedsheet.
*   The sequence of day and night.

Patterns help us to predict what will come next.

## Types of Patterns

We can create patterns using many different things. Let's look at some common types of patterns.

### 1. Patterns with Shapes

We can arrange different shapes in a sequence to make a pattern. The rule of the pattern is how the shapes are repeated.

**Example 1: Repeating two shapes**
Look at this pattern. A circle is followed by a square, and this repeats.

➡️ 🟡 🟥 🟡 🟥 🟡 🟥 ...

What will come next? A circle 🟡!

**Example 2: Repeating three shapes**
Here, one triangle is followed by two circles.

➡️ 🔺 🔵 🔵 🔺 🔵 🔵 ...

What will come next? A triangle 🔺!

### 2. Patterns with Objects and Pictures

We can also make patterns using pictures of objects we see every day.

**Example 1: Leaf and Flower**
A leaf is followed by a flower. This sequence repeats.

➡️ 🍃 🌸 🍃 🌸 🍃 🌸 ...

What will come next? A leaf 🍃!

**Example 2: Smiley and Star**
One smiley face is followed by one star.

➡️ 😊 ⭐ 😊 ⭐ 😊 ⭐ ...

What will come next? A smiley face 😊!

### 3. Patterns with Numbers

Numbers can also follow a rule to make a pattern.

**Example 1: Repeating Numbers**
In this pattern, the numbers 1, 2, and 3 repeat.

➡️ 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, ...

What will come next? The number 1!

**Example 2: Growing Numbers (Skip Counting)**
In this pattern, we are adding 2 each time. This is also called counting in 2s.

➡️ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...

What will come next? The number 12!

**Example 3: Decreasing Numbers**
In this pattern, we are going backward by 1.

➡️ 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, ...

What will come next? The number 4!

### 4. Growing Patterns

Some patterns grow in a predictable way. The number of objects increases in each step.

**Example 1:**
Here, we add one star in each step.

➡️ ⭐, ⭐⭐, ⭐⭐⭐, ⭐⭐⭐⭐, ...

What will come next? Five stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐!

**Example 2:**
Here, we add one block to the bottom in each step.

➡️ 🧱, 🧱🧱, 🧱🧱🧱, 🧱🧱🧱🧱, ...

What will come next? A line of five blocks 🧱🧱🧱🧱🧱!

Look at the patterns below and draw or write what comes next.

| Pattern | What comes next? |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🍎 🍌 🍎 🍌 🍎 🍌 ... | ? |
| ⬆️ ⬇️ ⬆️ ⬇️ ⬆️ ⬇️ ... | ? |
| 5, 10, 5, 10, 5, 10, ... | ? |
| 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, ... | ? |
| 🔶, 🔶🔶, 🔶🔶🔶, ... | ? |

## Summary

*   A **pattern** is a sequence of shapes, numbers, or objects that repeats in a specific order.
*   We can find patterns all around us in nature and in things we make.
*   Patterns can be made of **shapes**, **pictures**, or **numbers**.
*   Some patterns **repeat** the same items (e.g., A, B, A, B, ...).
*   Some patterns **grow** or **decrease** in a predictable way (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8, ...).
*   Understanding patterns helps us guess what will come next.
