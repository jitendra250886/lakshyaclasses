# Chapter 12: Money

Hello students! Have you ever wondered how we buy our favourite toys, chocolates, or ice creams? We use **money**! Money is what we give to a shopkeeper to buy the things we need or want. In India, our money is called the **Rupee (₹)**.

Let's learn about the different coins and notes we use every day.

## Coins We Use in India

Coins are small, metal pieces of money. They are round and have a number on them that tells us their value.

Here are the coins we commonly use:

| Coin | Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  | ₹1 | One Rupee |
|  | ₹2 | Two Rupees |
|  | ₹5 | Five Rupees |
|  | ₹10 | Ten Rupees |
|  | ₹20 | Twenty Rupees |

## Notes We Use in India

Notes are made of paper. They are also called currency notes. Like coins, they have a number that shows their value.

Here are some notes we commonly use:

| Note | Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  | ₹10 | Ten Rupees |
|  | ₹20 | Twenty Rupees |
|  | ₹50 | Fifty Rupees |
|  | ₹100 | One Hundred Rupees |

## Counting Money

To find out how much money we have, we just add the values of all the coins and notes together.

**Example 1: Counting Coins**
Imagine you have these coins in your piggy bank:
- One ₹5 coin
- One ₹2 coin
- One ₹1 coin

To find the total, we add them:
₹5 + ₹2 + ₹1 = ₹8
So, you have **8 rupees**.

**Example 2: Counting Notes and Coins**
Imagine your mom gives you:
- One ₹10 note
- One ₹5 coin

To find the total, we add them:
₹10 + ₹5 = ₹15
So, you have **15 rupees**.

## Making a Given Amount

We can use different combinations of coins to make the same amount of money.

**How can you make ₹4?**
- **Method 1:** Using four ₹1 coins.
  (₹1 + ₹1 + ₹1 + ₹1 = ₹4)
- **Method 2:** Using two ₹2 coins.
  (₹2 + ₹2 = ₹4)
- **Method 3:** Using one ₹2 coin and two ₹1 coins.
  (₹2 + ₹1 + ₹1 = ₹4)

## Let's Go Shopping!

When we buy something, we need to pay the correct amount of money.

Look at the price tags on these items:

| Item | Price |
| :--- | :--- |
| Pencil | ₹3 |
| Eraser | ₹2 |
| Toffee | ₹1 |
| Toy Car | ₹10 |

**Question 1:** How much money do you need to buy one pencil and one eraser?
- **Answer:** Cost of pencil + Cost of eraser
- ₹3 + ₹2 = ₹5
- You need **₹5**.

**Question 2:** How much money do you need to buy a toy car and a toffee?
- **Answer:** Cost of toy car + Cost of toffee
- ₹10 + ₹1 = ₹11
- You need **₹11**.
