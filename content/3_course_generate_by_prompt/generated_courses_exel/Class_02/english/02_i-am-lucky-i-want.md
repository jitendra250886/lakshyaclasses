# Part 1: I Am Lucky (Poem)

## Introduction to the Poem
"I Am Lucky" is a sweet poem where a little child imagines being different creatures like a butterfly, a myna, and a fish. After thinking about all the wonderful things these creatures can do, the child concludes that they are luckiest to be themselves, because they can think and be happy.

## Explanation of the Poem
*   The child first wishes to be a **butterfly** to fly around and be thankful for its wings.
*   Then, the child imagines being a **myna** in a tree, singing happily and being thankful for the ability to sing.
*   Next, the child thinks about being a **fish** in the sea, wriggling and giggling with glee (happiness).
*   The child also thinks it would be fun to be an **elephant** and raise its trunk, or a **kangaroo** and hop right up to the moon, or an **octopus** with eight wiggly arms.
*   In the end, the child stops and thinks. The child realizes that they are lucky to be "me" and not any of those creatures. Why? Because a child can think, laugh, and play, which makes them truly happy and thankful.

*   **Self-Acceptance:** Understanding that you are special just the way you are.
