## Part 1: Zoo Manners (Poem)

This poem tells us about the right way to behave when we visit a zoo. It reminds us that animals are living beings with feelings, and we should treat them with care and respect.

### Poem Text

> Be careful what you say or do
> When you visit the animals at the zoo.
>
> Don’t make fun of the Camel’s hump –
> He’s very proud of his noble bump.
>
> Don’t laugh too much at the Chimpanzee –
> He thinks he’s as wise as you or me.
>
> And the Penguins strutting round the lake
> Can understand remarks you make.
>
> Treat them as well as they do you,
> And you’ll always be welcome at the Zoo.

### Explanation of the Poem

*   **Stanza 1:** The poet advises children to be very careful about their words and actions when they are at the zoo.
*   **Stanza 2:** We should not make fun of the camel's hump. The camel is very proud of it, and the poet calls it a "noble bump."
*   **Stanza 3:** We should not laugh at the chimpanzee. The chimpanzee is a very intelligent animal and thinks he is as wise as humans.
*   **Stanza 4:** The penguins walking proudly around the lake can understand what we say about them. We should not make any rude remarks.
*   **Stanza 5:** The final message is to treat the animals well, just as they treat us. If we are kind to them, we will always be welcome at the zoo.

## Part 2: Funny Bunny (Story)

This is a funny story about a rabbit who gets scared by a falling nut and creates a panic.

### Story Summary

One day, a little rabbit named Funny Bunny was sitting under a tree. A nut fell on his head, and he thought the sky was falling! He got scared and decided to run and tell the King.

On his way, he met several other animals:
*   Henny Penny (a hen)
*   Cocky Locky (a cock)
*   Lucky Ducky (a duck)
*   Poosey Goosey (a goose)

He told each of them that the sky was falling, and they all got scared and started running with him.

Finally, they met a clever and cunning fox named Woxy Foxy. The fox asked them where they were going. When they told him their story, he tricked them by saying, "Follow me, I will take you to the King." He led them all into his cave, and then the wicked fox ate them all up. Funny Bunny, Henny Penny, Cocky Locky, Lucky Ducky, and Poosey Goosey were never seen again.

**Moral of the story:** We should not believe everything we hear and should think before acting. We must also be careful of strangers who may try to trick us.
