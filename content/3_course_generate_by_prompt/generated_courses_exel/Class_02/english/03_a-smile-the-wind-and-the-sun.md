# Chapter 3: A Smile, The Wind and The Sun

This chapter is divided into two parts: a lovely poem called "A Smile" and an interesting story, "The Wind and the Sun".

## Part 1: A Smile (Poem)

This short and sweet poem tells us about the magic of a smile.

### Poem Text

> A smile is quite a funny thing,
> It wrinkles up your face,
> And when it’s gone
> You’ll never find
> Its secret hiding place.
>
> But far more wonderful it is
> To see what smiles can do;
> You smile at one,
> He smiles at you,
> And so one smile makes two.

### Explanation of the Poem

*   The poet says that a smile is a "funny thing" because it creates small lines, or **wrinkles**, on our face.
*   When a smile disappears, we can never find where it goes. It has a "secret hiding place."
*   The most wonderful thing about a smile is its power. When you smile at someone, they often smile back at you.
*   In this way, your one smile creates another smile, and "one smile makes two." It shows that happiness is contagious and spreads from one person to another.
