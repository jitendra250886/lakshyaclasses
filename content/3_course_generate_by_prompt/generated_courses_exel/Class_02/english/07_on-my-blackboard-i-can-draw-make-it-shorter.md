## Part 2: Story - Make It Shorter

This is a famous story about Emperor Akbar and his clever minister, Birbal. It shows how a problem can be solved with smart thinking.

### Story Summary

One day, Emperor Akbar drew a line on the floor and gave his ministers a challenge. He ordered them, "Make this line shorter, but you must not rub out or erase any part of it."

All the ministers were confused. They looked at the line and thought hard, but no one could figure out how to make the line shorter without touching it.

Just then, Birbal, the wisest minister, smiled and went near the line. He quietly drew a **longer line** right below Akbar's line.

Now, everyone could see that Akbar's original line looked shorter in comparison to the new, longer line drawn by Birbal. Akbar and all the other ministers were impressed by Birbal's cleverness.

### Moral of the Story

The story teaches us that you can solve a problem with cleverness and wit. Sometimes, the best solution is not the most obvious one.
