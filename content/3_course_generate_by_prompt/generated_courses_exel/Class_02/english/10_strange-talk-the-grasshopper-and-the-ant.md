## Part 1: Strange Talk (Poem)

### Poem Text

> A little green frog lived under a log,
> And every time he spoke
> Instead of saying, “Good morning!”
> He only said, “Croak-croak.”
>
> A duck lived by the water-side
> And little did he lack,
> But when we asked, “How do you do?”
> He only said, “Quack-quack.”
>
> A little pig lived in a sty,
> As fat as he could be,
> And when he asked for food
> He cried aloud, “Wee-wee.”
>
> A puppy lived in a kennel,
> And what a queer little chap,
> When I said, “May I have some food?”
> He only said, “Bow-wow.”
>
> If all these animals talked as much
> As little girls and boys,
> And all of them tried to speak at once,
> Wouldn’t it make a noise!

### Summary of the Poem

This poem is about the "strange talk" of different animals. The poet describes a frog that says "Croak-croak," a duck that says "Quack-quack," a pig that cries "Wee-wee," and a puppy that barks "Bow-wow." These are their ways of speaking. The poet finds it funny that they can't speak words like us. In the end, the poet imagines how noisy it would be if all these animals talked as much as children do! The poem teaches us that every creature has its own unique way of communicating.

## Part 2: The Grasshopper and The Ant (Story)

### Story Summary

Once there lived a lazy grasshopper and a hard-working ant.

**During Summer:**
The grasshopper spent the sunny summer days singing songs and playing. He was very lazy. On the other hand, the ant worked hard all day. She collected grains of food and stored them in her home for the winter.

The grasshopper would often laugh at the ant and say, "Why do you work so hard? Come and enjoy the summer with me!" The ant would reply, "I am storing food for the winter. You should do the same." But the grasshopper did not listen.

**When Winter Came:**
Soon, summer ended and cold winter arrived. The ground was covered with snow, and there was no food to be found anywhere.

The grasshopper was now very cold and hungry. He had no food to eat and no place to stay warm. He remembered the hard-working ant. He went to her house and knocked on the door.

He asked the ant, "Can you please give me some food? I am starving."

The ant asked him, "What were you doing all summer when I was working hard?" The grasshopper sadly replied, "I was busy singing and playing." The ant then told him, "Then you can dance the winter away!" and shut her door. The lazy grasshopper learned his lesson the hard way.

### Moral of the Story

The story teaches us that we should **work hard today to have a safe and happy tomorrow**. It is important to plan for the future and not be lazy.
