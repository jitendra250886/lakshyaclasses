This is a funny poem about a mischievous person named Mr. Nobody. The poet says that there is a funny little man in every house who is as quiet as a mouse. He is the one who does all the mischief, like breaking plates or tearing books.

However, no one has ever seen his face. Everyone in the house agrees that all the naughty things that happen are done by this mysterious Mr. Nobody.

## Part 2: Curlylocks and The Three Bears (Story)

### Story Summary

Once upon a time, there was a little girl with curly hair named Curlylocks. One day, she went into a forest near her house. There, she saw a small cottage. She wondered who lived there and went inside.

Inside the cottage, she saw three bowls of porridge on a table.
*   A **big bowl** for Papa Bear.
*   A **middle-sized bowl** for Mama Bear.
*   A **tiny little bowl** for Baby Bear.

Curlylocks was hungry. She tasted the porridge from the big bowl, but it was too hot. She tasted the porridge from the middle-sized bowl, but it was too cold. Then, she tasted the porridge from the tiny little bowl, and it was just right! She ate it all up.

Next, Curlylocks saw three chairs.
*   A **big chair** for Papa Bear.
*   A **middle-sized chair** for Mama Bear.
*   A **tiny little chair** for Baby Bear.

She sat in the big chair, but it was too hard. She sat in the middle-sized chair, but it was too soft. Then, she sat in the tiny little chair, and it was just right! But as she sat down, the chair broke.

Feeling tired, Curlylocks went into the bedroom. She saw three beds.
*   A **big bed** for Papa Bear.
*   A **middle-sized bed** for Mama Bear.
*   A **tiny little bed** for Baby Bear.

The big bed was too hard, and the middle-sized bed was too soft. But the tiny little bed was just right. Curlylocks fell fast asleep in the tiny little bed.

Soon, the Bear family came back home.
"Somebody ate my porridge!" growled Papa Bear.
"Somebody ate my porridge too!" said Mama Bear.
"Somebody finished all my porridge!" cried Baby Bear.

Then they went to the living room.
"Somebody sat in my chair!" growled Papa Bear.
"Somebody sat in my chair too!" said Mama Bear.
"Somebody broke my chair!" cried Baby Bear.

Finally, they went into the bedroom.
"Somebody slept in my bed!" growled Papa Bear.
"Somebody slept in my bed too!" said Mama Bear.
"Somebody is sleeping in my bed!" shouted Baby Bear.

Curlylocks woke up, saw the three bears, and was very scared. She jumped out of the bed and ran out of the cottage as fast as she could.

The first is a poem, **"Mr. Nobody,"** about an imaginary person who is blamed for all the small, mischievous things that happen in a house, but whom no one has ever seen. The second is a classic tale, **"Curlylocks and The Three Bears,"** about a curious girl who enters the home of a bear family. She tries their porridge, chairs, and beds, finding the Baby Bear's things to be "just right." When the bears return, she gets scared and runs away.
