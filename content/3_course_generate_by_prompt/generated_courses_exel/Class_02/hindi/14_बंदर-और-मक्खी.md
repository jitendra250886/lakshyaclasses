## Story Summary (कहानी का सार)

1.  **The Annoyed Lion:** In a forest, a lion was resting after his meal. A fly started buzzing around his ear, disturbing his sleep. The lion tried to shoo her away, but she kept coming back.
2.  **The Lion's Frustration:** The lion got very angry. He swiped at the fly with his paw but missed. Instead, he scratched his own ear and nose. He tried again and again, injuring himself in the process, but he couldn't catch the fly. Finally, tired and hurt, the lion gave up and told the fly to leave.
3.  **The Fly's Arrogance:** The fly became very proud. She thought, "I have defeated the king of the jungle! I am the strongest of all." She flew off, boasting about her victory.
4.  **Meeting the Elephant:** On her way, she met an elephant. She proudly told the elephant to bow to her because she had defeated the lion. The elephant thought it was silly to argue with a tiny fly and simply saluted her and walked away. The fly became even more arrogant.
5.  **Meeting the Clever Fox:** Next, she met a fox. She boasted to the fox as well. The clever fox understood the fly's arrogance. The fox bowed and said, "Oh great Queen Fly! You are truly the greatest."
6.  **The Fox's Trick:** The fox then pointed to a spider's web and said, "But that spider over there is calling you names. You should teach her a lesson."
7.  **The Fly's Downfall:** Blinded by her pride, the fly flew straight towards the spider to challenge her. As soon as she flew close, she got stuck in the sticky spider web. She tried hard to get out, but the more she struggled, the more entangled she became. The clever fox watched this, smiled, and quietly walked away.
