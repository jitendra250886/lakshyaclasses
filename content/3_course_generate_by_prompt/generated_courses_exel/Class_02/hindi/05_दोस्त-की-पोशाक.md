# Chapter 5: दोस्त की पोशाक (Dost ki Poshak - The Friend's Outfit)

## Introduction to the Chapter

This chapter tells a funny story about two old friends, Naseeruddin and Jamal Sahab. The story revolves around a special outfit (`पोशाक`) that Naseeruddin lends to his friend. It humorously shows how talking too much, or trying too hard not to talk about something, can lead to awkward and funny situations.

## Characters in the Story

*   **Naseeruddin (नसीरुद्दीन):** A friendly and talkative person who loves his friend but is a bit thoughtless. He wants to show his friend around the neighborhood.
*   **Jamal Sahab (जमाल साहब):** Naseeruddin's old friend. He is a bit conscious about his clothes and gets embarrassed easily.

## Story Explanation

The story unfolds in a series of meetings, each one becoming funnier and more awkward for Jamal Sahab.

1.  **Jamal Sahab's Visit:** Jamal Sahab visits his old friend Naseeruddin. Naseeruddin is very happy to see him and wants to take him to meet some neighbors. However, Jamal Sahab refuses because he is wearing a very ordinary outfit (`मामूली-सी पोशाक`).

2.  **The Borrowed Outfit:** To solve the problem, Naseeruddin brings out his own special, brightly colored long coat, a `भड़कीली अचकन`, and insists that Jamal Sahab wear it. After getting dressed, they both go out.

3.  **The First Meeting:** They meet a neighbor. While introducing his friend, Naseeruddin says, "This is my old friend, Jamal Sahab. And the achkan he is wearing is mine." Hearing this, Jamal Sahab gets very embarrassed and angry. He tells Naseeruddin never to mention the borrowed achkan again.

4.  **The Second Meeting:** Naseeruddin apologizes and they go to meet another friend, Hussain Sahab. This time, when Hussain Sahab praises the beautiful achkan, Naseeruddin, trying to keep his promise, lies and says, "Oh, this achkan is his own!" Jamal Sahab is shocked and angry again because Naseeruddin told a lie.

5.  **The Third Meeting:** Naseeruddin apologizes once more and promises not to say anything about the achkan. They meet another neighbor. To avoid the topic completely, Naseeruddin introduces his friend and then says, "It's better not to talk about the achkan he is wearing." This makes the situation even more awkward.

6.  **The Conclusion:** Completely frustrated and embarrassed, Jamal Sahab has had enough. He tells Naseeruddin that he doesn't want to go anywhere else and asks to go back home.
