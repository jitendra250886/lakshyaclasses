# Chapter 4: Counting In Tens

## Introduction: The Story of the Clever Fox

Once, there was a farmer who had many chickens. Every day, a clever but naughty fox would come and try to steal the chickens. The farmer wanted to count her chickens every morning to make sure none were missing.

Counting them one by one took a very long time! "1, 2, 3, 4, ... oh, I lost count!" she would say.

One day, she had a brilliant idea. She decided to put 10 chickens in one basket.

*   She made one basket of **10** chickens.
*   She made a second basket of **10** chickens.
*   She made a third basket of **10** chickens.
*   After filling 3 baskets, she had **4** chickens left over.

Now, counting was easy! She had **3 baskets of 10** and **4 single** chickens.
That's 3 tens and 4 ones, which is **34** chickens!

This clever way of grouping things in tens to count them is called **Counting in Tens**.

## What is Counting in Tens?

Counting in tens is a fast and easy way to count large numbers. Instead of counting every single item one by one, we first make groups of 10.

*   A group of 10 items is called **one ten**.
*   The items that are left over (and are less than 10) are called **ones**.

For example, look at these sticks:



*   There are **2** bundles of 10 sticks each. So, we have **2 tens**.
*   There are **3** single sticks left over. So, we have **3 ones**.
*   **2 tens** and **3 ones** make the number **23**.
*   2 tens = 20
*   3 ones = 3
*   Total = 20 + 3 = 23

## Understanding Tens and Ones

Every two-digit number is made up of tens and ones. Let's break down some numbers:

| Number | How to Read It | Tens | Ones | Expanded Form |
| :----: | :---------------- | :--: | :--: | :-----------: |
| **45** | Four tens, five ones | 4 | 5 | 40 + 5 |
| **62** | Six tens, two ones | 6 | 2 | 60 + 2 |
| **80** | Eight tens, zero ones | 8 | 0 | 80 + 0 |
| **19** | One ten, nine ones | 1 | 9 | 10 + 9 |
| **33** | Three tens, three ones | 3 | 3 | 30 + 3 |

## Let's Practice!

**Question 1:** A flower seller has made garlands of 10 flowers each. She has 5 full garlands and 8 loose flowers. How many flowers does she have in total?

*   **Answer:**
    *   5 garlands of 10 flowers = 5 tens = 50
    *   8 loose flowers = 8 ones = 8
    *   Total flowers = 50 + 8 = **58 flowers**.

**Question 2:** How many tens and ones are in the number 74?

*   **Answer:**
    *   The number 74 has **7 tens** and **4 ones**.

**Question 3:** Bhanu sells bangles. He has 8 packets with 10 bangles in each packet, and 1 loose bangle. How many bangles does he have?

*   **Answer:**
    *   8 packets of 10 bangles = 8 tens = 80
    *   1 loose bangle = 1 one = 1
    *   Total bangles = 80 + 1 = **81 bangles**.

## Skip Counting by 10

When we count in tens, we are "jumping" or "skipping" by 10 each time. This is a very useful skill!

### Counting Forward by 10
You just add 10 to the previous number.
**10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100**

You can start from any number:
**14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, ...**

### Counting Backward by 10
You just subtract 10 from the previous number.
**90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10**

You can start from any number:
**88, 78, 68, 58, 48, 38, ...**

## Summary

*   Counting in tens is a quick method to count large numbers by making groups of 10.
*   A group of 10 is called a **ten**. The leftover items are called **ones**.
*   A number like 56 can be broken down into **5 tens** (50) and **6 ones** (6).
*   Skip counting by 10 (like 10, 20, 30...) helps us count forward and backward quickly.
