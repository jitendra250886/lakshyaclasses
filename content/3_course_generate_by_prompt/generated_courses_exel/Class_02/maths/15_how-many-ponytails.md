# How Many Ponytails?

## Introduction: Counting and Collecting Information

Hello friends! Have you ever noticed how different your friends look? Some have short hair, some have long hair. Some make one ponytail, and some make two!

In this chapter, we will learn a fun way to collect information, put it in order, and understand it easily. This is called **Data Handling**. Let's start by counting the ponytails in a classroom.

Imagine we look around our class and see:
*   Some girls have **one ponytail**.
*   Some girls have **two ponytails**.
*   Some boys have **no ponytails** (short hair).

How can we keep track of this information without getting confused? We can use a table!

## How to Organize Data: Using a Table

A table helps us to write down information neatly so we can understand it at a glance.

### Example 1: Ponytails in the Class

Let's say we count the children in a class and find the following:

| Type of Hairstyle | Number of Children |
| :---------------- | :----------------- |
| One Ponytail      | 12                 |
| Two Ponytails     | 10                 |
| Short Hair (Boys) | 15                 |

Now, by looking at this table, we can easily answer some questions.

**Questions:**
1.  **How many children have one ponytail?**
    *   Answer: 12
2.  **How many children have two ponytails?**
    *   Answer: 10
3.  **What is the total number of children with ponytails?**
    *   Answer: 12 (one ponytail) + 10 (two ponytails) = 22 children.
4.  **How many children are there in the class in total?**
    *   Answer: 12 + 10 + 15 = 37 children.

See? A table makes everything so simple!

## More Examples of Handling Data

We can collect and organize data about many things around us.

### Example 2: Favourite Colours

Let's ask our friends about their favourite colours and make a table.

| Favourite Colour | Number of Children |
| :--------------- | :----------------- |
| Red              | 8                  |
| Blue             | 10                 |
| Green            | 5                  |
| Yellow           | 7                  |

**Let's answer some questions from the table:**
*   **Which colour is liked by the most children?**
    *   Blue (10 children)
*   **Which colour is liked by the least children?**
    *   Green (5 children)
*   **How many children like Red?**
    *   8 children

### Example 3: Numbers on a Dice

When you play a game with a dice, different numbers come up. Let's say we throw a dice 20 times and note down which number appears each time.

| Face of the Dice | How Many Times It Came Up |
| :--------------- | :------------------------ |
| 1                | 3                         |
| 2                | 5                         |
| 3                | 4                         |
| 4                | 2                         |
| 5                | 4                         |
| 6                | 2                         |

**Questions:**
*   **Which number appeared the most times?**
    *   The number 2 (appeared 5 times).
*   **Which numbers appeared the least number of times?**
    *   The numbers 4 and 6 (appeared 2 times each).

### Example 4: Chapatis Eaten by Animals

In a story, different animals are eating chapatis. Let's see how many each one eats.

| Animal | Number of Chapatis |
| :----- | :----------------- |
| Deer   | 5                  |
| Monkey | 8                  |
| Bear   | 4                  |
| Rabbit | 2                  |

**Questions:**
*   **Which animal eats the most chapatis?**
    *   Monkey (8 chapatis).
*   **Which animal eats the least chapatis?**
    *   Rabbit (2 chapatis).

## Practice Time!

1.  Ask your family members what their favourite fruit is (Apple, Banana, Mango, Orange). Make a table like the ones above and write down the numbers.
2.  Look around your room. Count the number of books, pencils, and erasers you have. Put this information in a table.

## Summary

In this chapter, we learned how to handle data. The main steps are:
1.  **Collect Information:** We gather facts by counting or asking questions (like counting ponytails or asking about favourite colours).
2.  **Organize Information:** We put the collected information into a table to make it neat and easy to read.
3.  **Understand Information:** We look at the table to answer questions and find out interesting things, like what is most popular or least common.
