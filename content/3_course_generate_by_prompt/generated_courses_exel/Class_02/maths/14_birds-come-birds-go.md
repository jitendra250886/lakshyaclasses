# Chapter 14: Birds Come Birds Go

## Introduction

Welcome, students! In this chapter, we will learn about addition and subtraction in a fun and interesting way. We will follow a story about birds coming and going, and use this story to understand how to add and subtract two-digit numbers. We will also learn a cool trick using "Smart Cards" to make maths even easier!

## 1. Addition: More Birds Come!

Addition means finding the total number of things when you put two or more groups together. It's like counting everything all at once.

**Example:**
There are 25 birds sitting on a tree. 16 more birds come and join them. How many birds are there in all?

To find the total, we need to add **25 + 16**.

### Method 1: Breaking Down Numbers

We can make addition easy by breaking the numbers into **Tens** and **Ones**.

- **25** is **20 + 5**
- **16** is **10 + 6**

Now, let's add them step-by-step:

1.  **Add the Tens:** 20 + 10 = 30
2.  **Add the Ones:** 5 + 6 = 11
3.  **Add the results together:** 30 + 11 = 41

So, there are **41** birds in total.

### Method 2: Using Smart Cards

Let's imagine we have two types of cards:
- A yellow square card 🟨 is for **10**.
- A blue triangle card 🟦 is for **1**.

1.  **Represent the numbers with cards:**
    - For **25**, we need 2 (🟨) cards and 5 (🟦) cards.
      > 🟨 🟨 🟦 🟦 🟦 🟦 🟦
    - For **16**, we need 1 (🟨) card and 6 (🟦) cards.
      > 🟨 🟦 🟦 🟦 🟦 🟦 🟦

2.  **Combine all the cards:**
    - Count all the 🟨 cards: 2 + 1 = 3 🟨
    - Count all the 🟦 cards: 5 + 6 = 11 🟦

3.  **Group the Ones:**
    - We have 11 🟦 cards. We know that 10 🟦 cards make one 🟨 card.
    - So, we can group 10 of the 🟦 cards to make a new 🟨 card, and we will have 1 🟦 card left over.
      > 🟦🟦🟦🟦🟦🟦🟦🟦🟦🟦 ➡️ 🟨

4.  **Find the final total:**
    - We had 3 🟨 cards and we made 1 new 🟨 card. Total = 4 🟨 cards.
    - We have 1 🟦 card left.
    - So, we have 4 🟨 and 1 🟦. That makes the number **41**.

## 2. Subtraction: Birds Go Away

Subtraction means taking away a smaller number from a bigger number to see what is left.

**Example:**
There are 60 cranes near a lake. 26 of them fly away. How many cranes are left?

To find out, we need to subtract **60 - 26**.

### Method: Using Smart Cards (Borrowing)

1.  **Represent the starting number (60) with cards:**
    - For **60**, we need 6 (🟨) cards and 0 (🟦) cards.
      > 🟨 🟨 🟨 🟨 🟨 🟨

2.  **Look at the number to subtract (26):**
    - We need to take away 2 🟨 cards and 6 🟦 cards.
    - But wait! We don't have any 🟦 cards to take away.

3.  **Borrow from the Tens:**
    - We can trade one 🟨 card for ten 🟦 cards.
    - So, we take 1 🟨 card away and get 10 🟦 cards instead.
      > 🟨 ➡️ 🟦🟦🟦🟦🟦🟦🟦🟦🟦🟦
    - Now we have **5** 🟨 cards and **10** 🟦 cards. The total value is still 60!

4.  **Now, subtract 26:**
    - From the 5 🟨 cards, take away 2 🟨 cards. You are left with **3** 🟨 cards.
    - From the 10 🟦 cards, take away 6 🟦 cards. You are left with **4** 🟦 cards.

5.  **Find the final answer:**
    - We are left with 3 🟨 cards and 4 🟦 cards.
    - That makes the number **34**.

So, **34** cranes are left.

## 3. Practice Problems

Let's solve some word problems using these methods.

| Problem | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Addition:** Rahul scored 47 runs and Virat scored 35 runs. How many runs did they score in total? | **Breakdown Method:**<br>47 = 40 + 7<br>35 = 30 + 5<br>Add Tens: 40 + 30 = 70<br>Add Ones: 7 + 5 = 12<br>Total: 70 + 12 = **82 runs** |
| **2. Subtraction:** Nisha had 56 pencils. She gave 29 pencils to her friend. How many pencils are left with Nisha? | **Using Borrowing:**<br>We need to solve 56 - 29.<br>We can't subtract 9 from 6.<br>So, we borrow 1 Ten from 5 Tens. We are left with 4 Tens.<br>The 6 Ones become 16 Ones.<br>Subtract Ones: 16 - 9 = 7<br>Subtract Tens: 4 - 2 = 2<br>Answer: **27 pencils** |

## Summary

In this chapter, we learned about addition and subtraction of two-digit numbers.

-   **Addition** is used to find the total when groups are combined.
-   **Subtraction** is used to find how much is left after something is taken away.
-   We can make calculations easier by **breaking numbers into Tens and Ones**.
-   The **Smart Card method** helps us visually understand how to "carry over" in addition and "borrow" in subtraction.
