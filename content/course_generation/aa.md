## 1.1 Mode of Nutrition in Plants

All living organisms need food for energy, growth, and repair. The way organisms obtain and utilize food is called **nutrition**.

- **Autotrophic Nutrition:**  
  Plants make their own food using simple substances like carbon dioxide and water in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll. This mode is called autotrophic nutrition. Plants are **autotrophs**.

- **Heterotrophic Nutrition:**  
  Animals and some plants depend on other organisms for food. They are called **heterotrophs**.

## 1.2 Photosynthesis – Food Making Process in Plants

**Photosynthesis** is the process by which green plants prepare their food using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water.

### Raw Materials Required:
- **Carbon dioxide (CO₂):** Taken from the air through **stomata** (tiny pores on leaves).
- **Water (H₂O):** Absorbed by roots from the soil and transported to leaves.
- **Chlorophyll:** A green pigment in leaves that captures sunlight.
- **Sunlight:** Provides energy for the process.

### Process:
In the presence of sunlight, chlorophyll helps combine carbon dioxide and water to form **carbohydrates** (mainly glucose). **Oxygen** is released as a by-product.

**Photosynthesis Equation:**

\[
\text{Carbon dioxide} + \text{Water} \xrightarrow{\text{Sunlight, Chlorophyll}} \text{Carbohydrate} + \text{Oxygen}
\]

### Importance:
- Produces food for plants and indirectly for all animals.
- Releases oxygen necessary for the survival of most living beings.
- Stores solar energy in the form of food.

## 1.3 Other Modes of Nutrition in Plants

Not all plants are autotrophs. Some use different modes of nutrition:

- **Parasitic Plants:**  
  Example: *Cuscuta* (Amarbel) lacks chlorophyll and derives food from host plants.

- **Saprotrophic Plants:**  
  Example: Fungi like mushrooms and bread moulds absorb nutrients from dead and decaying matter.

- **Insectivorous Plants:**  
  Example: *Pitcher plant* traps and digests insects to obtain nutrients, especially nitrogen.

- **Symbiotic Plants:**  
  Example: *Lichens* are associations between algae and fungi. Algae provide food, and fungi provide water and minerals.

## 1.4 How Nutrients are Replenished in the Soil

Plants absorb nutrients from the soil, which depletes over time. To maintain soil fertility:

- **Fertilizers and Manure:** Add nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
- **Biological Nitrogen Fixation:**  
  Bacteria like *Rhizobium* live in the root nodules of leguminous plants (e.g., peas, beans) and convert atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form. This is a **symbiotic relationship**.

---

## Activities and Experiments

- **Starch Test:**  
  Boil a leaf, dip it in alcohol, then add iodine. Blue-black color indicates presence of starch.

- **Destarching a Plant:**  
  Keep a plant in the dark for 2–3 days to remove stored starch before testing photosynthesis.

- **Microscopic Observation:**  
  Observe stomata on a leaf peel under a microscope.

---

## Summary

- Plants make their own food through photosynthesis using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.
- Not all plants are autotrophs; some are parasitic, saprotrophic, insectivorous, or symbiotic.
- Photosynthesis is essential for life on Earth as it produces food and oxygen.
- Soil nutrients are replenished using fertilizers or through natural processes like nitrogen fixation.

## Key Terms

- **Nutrition:** Process of obtaining and utilizing food.  
- **Autotrophs:** Organisms that make their own food.  
- **Heterotrophs:** Organisms that depend on others for food.  
- **Photosynthesis:** Process by which green plants make food.  
- **Chlorophyll:** Green pigment in leaves that captures sunlight.  
- **Stomata:** Tiny pores on leaves for gas exchange.  
- **Parasite:** Organism that lives on another and derives nutrients.  
- **Saprotrophs:** Organisms feeding on dead and decaying matter.  
- **Symbiosis:** Mutual relationship between two organisms.  
- **Insectivorous Plants:** Plants that trap and digest insects.
